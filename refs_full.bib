  abstract       = {The rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Kr), plays
                   a key role in repolarisation of cardiac ventricular
                   action potentials (APs). In recent years, a novel
                   clinical condition denoted the short QT syndrome (SQTS)
                   has been identified and, very recently, gain in
                   function mutations in the gene encoding the
                   pore-forming sub-unit of the I(Kr) channel have been
                   proposed to underlie SQTS in some patients. Here,
                   computer simulations were used to investigate the
                   effects of the selective loss of voltage-dependent
                   inactivation of I(Kr) upon ventricular APs and on the
                   QT interval of the electrocardiogram. I(Kr) and
                   inactivation-deficient I(Kr) were incorporated into
                   Luo-Rudy ventricular AP models. Inactivation-deficient
                   I(Kr) produced AP shortening that was heterogeneous
                   between endocardial, mid-myocardial, and epicardial
                   ventricular cell models, irrespective of whether
                   heterogeneity between these sub-regions was
                   incorporated of slow delayed rectifier K(+) current
                   (I(Ks)) alone, or of I(Ks) together with that of
                   transient outward K(+) current. The selective loss of
                   rectification of I(Kr) did not augment transmural
                   dispersion of AP repolarisation, as AP shortening was
                   greater in mid-myocardial than in endo- or epicardial
                   cell models. Simulated conduction through a 1 D
                   transmural ventricular strand was altered by
                   incorporation of inactivation-deficient I(Kr) and the
                   reconstructed QT interval was shortened. Collectively,
                   these results substantiate the notion that selective
                   loss of I(Kr) inactivation produces a gain in I(Kr)
                   function that causes QT interval shortening.},

  abstract       = {OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated
                   with a decrease in atrial ERP and ERP adaptation to
                   rate as well as changes in atrial conduction velocity.
                   The cellular changes in repolarization and the
                   underlying ionic mechanisms in human AF are only poorly
                   understood. METHODS: Action potentials (AP) and ionic
                   currents were studied with the patch clamp technique in
                   single atrial myocytes from patients in chronic AF and
                   compared to those from patients in stable sinus rhythm
                   (SR). RESULTS: The presence of AF was associated with a
                   marked shortening of the AP duration and a decreased
                   rate response of atrial repolarization. L-type calcium
                   current (ICa,L) and the transient outward current (Ito)
                   were both reduced about 70\% in AF, whereas an
                   increased steady-state outward current was detectable
                   at test potentials between -30 and 0 mV. The inward
                   rectifier potassium current (IKI) and the
                   acetylcholine-activated potassium current (IKACh) were
                   increased in AF at hyperpolarizing potentials.
                   Voltage-dependent inactivation of the fast sodium
                   current (INa) was shifted to more positive voltages in
                   AF. CONCLUSIONS: AF in humans leads to important
                   changes in atrial potassium and calcium currents that
                   likely contribute to the decrease in APD and APD rate
                   adaptation. These changes contribute to electrical
                   remodeling in AF and are therefore important factors
                   for the perpetuation of the arrhythmia.},

                   the human atrial action potential (AP) are poorly
                   understood. Using specific formulations of the K+, Na+,
                   and Ca2+ currents based on data recorded from human
                   atrial myocytes, along with representations of pump,
                   exchange, and background currents, we developed a
                   mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles
                   APs recorded from human atrial samples and responds to
                   rate changes, L-type Ca2+ current blockade, Na+/Ca2+
                   exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient
                   outward current amplitude in a fashion similar to
                   experimental recordings. Rate-dependent adaptation of
                   AP duration, an important determinant of susceptibility
                   to atrial fibrillation, was attributable to incomplete
                   L-type Ca2+ current recovery from inactivation and
                   incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at
                   rapid rates. Experimental observations of variable AP
                   morphology could be accounted for by changes in
                   transient outward current density, as suggested
                   experimentally. We conclude that this mathematical
                   model of the human atrial AP reproduces a variety of
                   observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the
                   mechanisms of clinically important AP properties.},

                   heterogeneity can lead to the breakdown of atrial
                   flutter into fibrillation. The exact distribution of
                   vagal mediated effects in the atria is unknown,
                   however. This study analyzed canine electrograms in
                   order to determine changes in APD. Electrograms were

                   stimulation. Simulations in a computer model were first
                   performed in order to determine how local acetylcholine
                   concentrations affect electrograms. Two measures were
                   investigated to assess APD changes. Results indicate
                   that APD is reduced nonuniformly, and contralateral
                   effects were seen.},

                   thought to be due to multiple, simultaneously
                   circulating wavelets. In the canine sterile
                   pericarditis model, the mechanisms of maintenance of AF
                   are not yet understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: During six
                   induced AF episodes in six dogs with sterile
                   pericarditis, 372 unipolar electrograms were recorded
                   simultaneously from an electrode array placed around
                   both atrial free walls, along with 10 to 24 electrodes
                   from the atrial septum, by use of a multiplexing
                   system. Activation maps during 12 consecutive 100-ms
                   windows were analyzed from an episode of sustained AF
                   in each dog (mean duration, 32 +/- 24 minutes). In two
                   dogs, two such activation maps during the same episode
                   of AF were analyzed. During AF, multiple unstable
                   reentrant circuits (mean number, 1.4 +/- 0.1 per 100-ms
                   analysis window) with very short cycle lengths (mean,
                   111 +/- 8 ms) present primarily in the atrial septum
                   and right atrium were responsible for maintenance of
                   AF. The unstable reentrant circuits frequently
                   disappeared and re-formed. Wave fronts traveling from
                   one atrium to the other and/or from the atrial septum
                   play an important role in re-formation of unstable
                   reentrant wave fronts. CONCLUSIONS: In this model of
                   paroxysmal AF, unstable reentrant circuits of very
                   short cycle length principally involving the atrial
                   septum appear to be critical for maintenance of AF.
                   Some reentrant circuits disappear as others re-form, so
                   that at least one reentrant circuit is always present.
                   Because the atria cannot follow their very short cycle
                   lengths in a 1:1 manner, AF is maintained.},

                   whether human atrial fibrillation (AF) relates to
                   steeply sloped action potential duration restitution
                   (APDR) kinetics and whether the spatial nonuniformity
                   of APDR promotes persistence of AF. BACKGROUND: A
                   steeply sloped APDR curve is known to be an important
                   determinant of the induction of more complex action
                   potential duration (APD) dynamics and fibrillation.
                   METHODS: Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation
                   (CAF) (n = 18), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) (n
                   = 14) and normal control subjects (n = 9) were studied.
                   The monophasic action potential duration at 90%
                   repolarization (APD90) and the effective refractory
                   period (ERP) were measured at six sites in the right
                   atrium. After AF was electrically converted, APDR was
                   assessed by delivering a single extrastimulus after a
                   train of stimuli at a cycle length of 600 ms (S1S2) at
                   six different sites of the right atrium, as well as
                   rapid pacing at cycle lengths that induced APD
                   alternans. RESULTS: The APD90 and ERP in patients with
                   CAF were shorter than those in patients with PAF and
                   control subjects (p < 0.05); however, the dispersions
                   of APD90 and ERP in each group were similar. The
                   maximal slopes of APDR by S1S2 and rapid pacing in
                   patients with CAF (1.2 {+/-} 0.4 and 1.7 {+/-} 0.2) and
                   PAF (1.1 {+/-} 0.4 and 1.3 {+/-} 0.4) were higher than
                   those in control subjects (0.5 {+/-} 0.3 and 0.8 {+/-}
                   0.2, respectively; p < 0.01). The maximal slope
                   obtained by S1S2 did not differ from that obtained by
                   rapid pacing in any group. The inter-regional
                   difference of the maximal slope in patients with CAF
                   (1.6 {+/-} 0.4, p < 0.05) was greater than that in
                   patients with PAF (1.2 {+/-} 0.3, p = NS vs. control)
                   and control subjects (0.4 {+/-} 0.2). CONCLUSIONS:
                   Atrial fibrillation was related to steeply sloped (>1)
                   APDR kinetics. The spatial dispersion of APDR in
                   patients with chronic AF was greater than that of
                   patients with paroxysmal AF and control subjects,
                   indicating that the heterogeneity of APDR of the atrium
                   plays an important role in the persistence of AF. },

  abstract       = {Wave propagation in ventricular muscle is rendered
                   highly anisotropic by the intramural rotation of the
                   fiber. This rotational anisotropy is especially
                   important because it can produce a twist of electrical
                   vortices, which measures the rate of rotation (in
                   degree/mm) of activation wavefronts in successive
                   planes perpendicular to a line of phase singularity, or
                   filament. This twist can then significantly alter the
                   dynamics of the filament. This paper explores this
                   dynamics via numerical simulation. After a review of
                   the literature, we present modeling tools that include:
                   (i) a simplified ionic model with three membrane
                   currents that approximates well the restitution
                   properties and spiral wave behavior of more complex
                   ionic models of cardiac action potential (Beeler-Reuter
                   and others), and (ii) a semi-implicit algorithm for the
                   fast solution of monodomain cable equations with
                   rotational anisotropy. We then discuss selected results
                   of a simulation study of vortex dynamics in a
                   parallelepipedal slab of ventricular muscle of varying
                   wall thickness (S) and fiber rotation rate (theta(z)).
                   The main finding is that rotational anisotropy
                   generates a sufficiently large twist to destabilize a
                   single transmural filament and cause a transition to a
                   wave turbulent state characterized by a high density of
                   chaotically moving filaments. This instability is
                   manifested by the propagation of localized disturbances
                   along the filament and has no previously known analog
                   in isotropic excitable media. These disturbances
                   correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of
                   filament, or "twistons," that create vortex rings when
                   colliding with the natural boundaries of the ventricle.
                   Moreover, when sufficiently twisted, these rings expand
                   and create additional filaments by further colliding
                   with boundaries. This instability mechanism is distinct
                   from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave
                   breakup that is not observed here during the initial
                   instability. For modified Beeler-Reuter-like kinetics
                   with stable reentry in two dimensions, decay into
                   turbulence occurs in the left ventricle in about one
                   second above a critical wall thickness in the range of
                   4-6 mm that matches experiment. However this decay is
                   suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability.
                   Specific experiments to test these results, and a
                   method to characterize the filament density during
                   fibrillation are discussed. Results are contrasted with
                   other mechanisms of fibrillation and future prospects
                   are summarized. (c)1998 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract       = {Investigating the mechanisms underlying the genesis
                   and conduction of electrical excitation in the atria at
                   physiological and pathological states is of great
                   importance. To provide knowledge concerning the
                   mechanisms of excitation, we constructed a biophysical
                   detailed and anatomically accurate computer model of
                   human atria that incorporates both structural and
                   electrophysiological heterogeneities.The
                   three-dimensional geometry was extracted from the
                   visible female dataset. The sinoatrial node (SAN) and
                   atrium, including crista terminalis (CT), pectinate
                   muscles (PM), appendages (APG) and Bachmann's bundle
                   (BB) were segmented in this work. Fibre orientation in
                   CT, PM and BB was set to local longitudinal
                   direction.Descriptions for all used cell types were
                   based on modifications of the Courtemanche et al. model
                   of a human atrial cell. Maximum conductances of Ito,
                   IKr and ICa,L were modified for PM, CT, APG and
                   atrioventricular ring to reproduce measured action
                   potentials (AP). Pacemaker activity in the human SAN
                   was reproduced by removing IK1, but including If,
                   ICa,T, and gradients of channel conductances as
                   described in previous studies for heterogeneous rabbit
                   SAN.Anisotropic conduction was computed with a
                   monodomain model using the finite element method. The
                   transversal to longitudinal ratio of conductivity for
                   PM, CT and BB was 1:9. Atrial working myocardium (AWM)
                   was set to be isotropic.Simulation of atrial
                   electrophysiology showed initiation of APs in the SAN
                   centre. The excitation spread afterwards to the
                   periphery near to the region of the CT and
                   preferentially towards the atrioventricular region. The
                   excitation extends over the right atrium along PM. Both
                   CT and PM activated the right AWM. Earliest activation
                   of the left atrium was through BB and excitation spread
                   over to the APG. The conduction velocities were 0.6ms-1
                   for AWM, 1.2ms-1 for CT, 1.6ms-1 for PM and 1.1ms-1 for
                   BB at a rate of 63bpm.The simulations revealed that
                   bundles form dominant pathways for atrial conduction.
                   The preferential conduction towards CT and along PM is
                   comparable with clinical mapping. Repolarization is
                   more homogeneous than excitation due to the
                   heterogeneous distribution of electrophysiological
                   properties and hence the action potential duration.},

                   single cell functional electrophysiological properties
                   associated with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), and
                   the contribution to these of accompanying ion current
                   changes. METHODS: The whole cell patch clamp technique
                   was used to record action potentials, the effective
                   refractory period (ERP) and ion currents, in the
                   absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically
                   isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6
                   months) AF and 39 patients in sinus rhythm. RESULTS:
                   Stimulation at high rates (up to 600 beats/min)
                   markedly shortened late repolarisation and the ERP in
                   cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised
                   the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Chronic AF was
                   associated with a reduction in the ERP at physiological
                   rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, P<0.05), and marked
                   attenuation in rate effects on the ERP and
                   repolarisation. The abbreviated terminal phase of
                   repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced
                   depolarisation of the MDP in cells from patients with
                   AF. The density of L-type Ca(2+) (I(CaL)) and transient
                   outward K(+) (I(TO)) currents was significantly reduced
                   in cells from patients with AF (by 60-65\%), whilst the
                   inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was increased,
                   and the sustained outward current (I(KSUS)) was
                   unaltered. Superfusion of cells from patients in sinus
                   rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l) moderately
                   shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the ERP
                   (228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-Aminopyridine (2 mmol/l)
                   markedly prolonged repolarisation and the ERP (by 35\%,
                   P<0.05). However, the combination of these drugs had no
                   effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.
                   CONCLUSION: Chronic AF in humans is associated with
                   attenuation in adaptation of the atrial single cell ERP
                   and MDP to fast rates, which may not be explained fully
                   by accompanying changes in I(CaL) and I(TO).},

                   restitution of the cardiac action potential (AP)
                   duration (APD) plays a major role in predisposing
                   ventricular tachycardia to degenerate to ventricular
                   fibrillation, whereas its role in atrial fibrillation
                   is unclear. We used the Courtemanche human atrial cell
                   model and the Luo-Rudy guinea pig ventricular model to
                   compare the roles of electrical restitution in
                   destabilizing spiral wave reentry in simulated
                   two-dimensional homogeneous atrial and ventricular
                   tissue. Because atrial AP morphology is complex, we
                   also validated the usefulness of effective refractory
                   period (ERP) restitution. ERP restitution correlated
                   best with APD restitution at transmembrane potentials
                   greater than or equal to -62 mV, and its steepness was
                   a reliable predictor of spiral wave phenotype (stable,
                   meandering, hypermeandering, and breakup) in both
                   atrial and ventricular tissue. Spiral breakup or single
                   hypermeandering spirals occurred when the slope of ERP
                   restitution exceeded 1 at short diastolic intervals.
                   Thus ERP restitution, which is easier to measure
                   clinically than APD restitution, is a reliable
                   determinant of spiral wave stability in simulated
                   atrial and ventricular tissue.},
