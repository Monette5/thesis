  abstract = {This study on rest and exercise atrial vectorcardiogram (Frank method)
	was carried out on a group of 27 healthy volunteers (Group A) and
	on a group of 24 patients with mitral stenosis (Group B). All 51
	subjects were women. Our original program was performed using a Hewlett
	Packard 2100 computer. The pattern recognition of every wave was
	carried out by analysing a particular function obtained by translating
	the X, Y, Z leads on the line joining the T-P, P-Q, ST segments.
	In the group B on rest a significant correlation between atrial vectorcardiogram
	parameters and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was not present.
	Between both group A and B the vectorcardiographic data were greatly
	superposables. It is difficult, because of the great interindividual
	variability of results obtained, to have very discriminant vectorcardiographic
	parameters between group A and group B on rest and during exercise,
	performed in the supine position with a bicycle ergometer. In the
	both groups A and B the exercise induces a significant increase of
	spatial magnitude of maximal P xyz vector (max P xyz) and maximal
	P amplitude on frontal and sagittal planes, with P loop shifting
	towards a vertical position. The following significant results were
	observed only in group B of mitral patients: 1) an increase of P
	wave duration; 2) an increase of the interval between the two peaks
	of P wave (measurable only in group B); 3) an increase in the amplitude
	and backward rotation of max P xyz azimuth and of the maximal vector
	backward directed on horizontal (H) plane; 4) an increase of P loop
	linear, tangential and areolar velocities. The P loop anterior and
	posterior area on H plane and of the spatial P xyz vectors changes
	during exercise were directionally similar in the normal group and
	in the patients with mitral stenosis. These results suggest a little
	diagnostic power of the P wave area changes during exercise. In both
	groups maximal atrial T vector increases with exertion, but only
	in group B migrates backward on H plane, suggesting an atrial gradient
	directed towards the left atrium.},

  abstract = {Quantitative ion channel model evaluation requires the estimation
	of voltage dependent rate constants. We have tested whether a unique
	set of rate constants can be reliably extracted from nonstationary
	macroscopic voltage clamp potassium current data. For many models,
	the rate constants derived independently at different membrane potentials
	are not unique. Therefore, our approach has been to use the exponential
	voltage dependence predicted from reaction rate theory (Stevens,
	C. F. 1978. Biophys. J. 22:295-306; Eyring, H., S. H. Lin, and S.
	M. Lin. 1980. Basic Chemical Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York)
	to couple the rate constants derived at different membrane potentials.
	This constrained the solution set of rate constants to only those
	that also obeyed this additional set of equations, which was sufficient
	to obtain a unique solution. We have tested this approach with data
	obtained from macroscopic delayed rectifier potassium channel currents
	in voltage-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocyte membranes. This
	potassium channel has relatively simple kinetics without an inactivation
	process and provided a convenient system to determine a globally
	optimized set of voltage-dependent rate constants for a Markov kinetic
	model. The ability of the fitting algorithm to extract rate constants
	from the macroscopic current data was tested using "data" synthesized
	from known rate constants. The simulated data sets were analyzed
	with the global fitting procedure and the fitted rate constants were
	compared with the rate constants used to generate the data. Monte
	Carlo methods were used to examine the accuracy of the estimated
	kinetic parameters. This global fitting approach provided a useful
	and convenient method for reliably extracting Markov rate constants
	from macroscopic voltage clamp data over a broad range of membrane
	potentials. The limitations of the method and the dependence on initial
	guesses are described.},

	In this paper a discrete analogue is constructed which is not straightforward

	In particular a deflation procedure greatly facilitates the iterative
	solution of the problem and overcomes the divergence encountered
	by other authors. Numerical solutions obtained for simple geometries
	are compared to the exact analytic solutions available in such cases.
	The necessary convergence of the solutions of the discrete analog
	towards the solution of the continuous problem is shown to occur
	only if the coefficients of the discrete analogue are carefully evaluated.
	Calculations are then presented for realistic thoracic geometries,
	typical results being presented as surface potential maps. Finally
	the important effect of the internal regional inhomogeneities, particularly
	a realistic cardiac blood mass, is demonstrated by obtaining vector

	syndrome undergoing surgery to ablate accessory atrioventricular
	pathways associated with tachyarrhythmias. Bipolar potentials were
	recorded simultaneously from 156 atrial epicardial electrodes arranged
	in three templates to fit the anterior and posterior aspects of both
	atria. Spontaneous or sinus rhythms were recorded, as were atrial
	escape rhythms after overdrive pacing at rates of 150 and 200 beats/min.
	Atrial activation maps revealed different patterns of impulse initiation
	varying from typical unifocal sinus node impulse origin, unifocal
	extranodal impulse origin, and multicentric impulse origin from two
	to four widely distributed atrial pacemaker sites. In subjects demonstrating
	only unifocal impulse origin during control or sinus rhythm, other
	widely divergent pacemaker sites were recorded in other maps during
	subsequent rhythms. In addition to sites located at the upper superior
	vena cava-right atrium junction, pacemakers also dominated at sites
	anterior and inferior to the sinus node region during both control
	and escape depolarizations. Most of the subjects were found to have
	two or more pacemaker sites when maps of all control and postpacing
	conditions were analyzed. The right atrial pacemaker region encompassed
	a zone of 7.5 X 1.5 cm centered about the long axis of the sulcus
	terminalis posteriorly and the precaval band anteriorly. An unexpected
	finding was the participation of left atrial escape pacemakers. The
	functional behavior of both the control and escape pacemakers, as
	assessed by sinus node recovery time, was normal, indicating physiologic
	operation of the extranodal sites as part of an overall system of
	distributed pacemakers involved in the control of rate. Although

	conduction velocity. The cellular changes in repolarization and the
	underlying ionic mechanisms in human AF are only poorly understood.
	METHODS: Action potentials (AP) and ionic currents were studied with
	the patch clamp technique in single atrial myocytes from patients
	in chronic AF and compared to those from patients in stable sinus
	rhythm (SR). RESULTS: The presence of AF was associated with a marked
	shortening of the AP duration and a decreased rate response of atrial
	repolarization. L-type calcium current (ICa,L) and the transient
	outward current (Ito) were both reduced about 70\% in AF, whereas
	an increased steady-state outward current was detectable at test
	potentials between -30 and 0 mV. The inward rectifier potassium current
	(IKI) and the acetylcholine-activated potassium current (IKACh) were
	increased in AF at hyperpolarizing potentials. Voltage-dependent
	inactivation of the fast sodium current (INa) was shifted to more
	positive voltages in AF. CONCLUSIONS: AF in humans leads to important
	changes in atrial potassium and calcium currents that likely contribute
	to the decrease in APD and APD rate adaptation. These changes contribute
	to electrical remodeling in AF and are therefore important factors
	for the perpetuation of the arrhythmia.},

	sinoatrial (SA) node in terms of cell morphology, pacemaker activity,
	action potential configuration and conduction, densities of ionic
	currents (i(Na), i(Ca,L), i(to), i(K,r), i(K,s) and i(f)), expression
	of gap junction proteins (Cx40, Cx43 and Cx45), autonomic regulation,
	and ageing. Experimental studies on the single SA node cell to the

	of the gradient model of the SA node, in which there is gradual change
	in the intrinsic properties of SA node cells from periphery to centre,
	and the alternative mosaic model, in which there is a variable mix
	of atrial and SA node cells from periphery to centre. The heterogeneity
	is important for the dependable functioning of the SA node as the
	pacemaker for the heart, because (i) via multiple mechanisms, it
	allows the SA node to drive the surrounding atrial muscle without
	being suppressed electrotonically; (ii) via an action potential duration
	gradient and a conduction block zone, it promotes antegrade propagation
	of excitation from the SA node to the right atrium and prevents reentry
	of excitation; and (iii) via pacemaker shift, it allows pacemaking
	to continue under diverse pathophysiological circumstances.},

  abstract = {1. An intracellular micro-electrode was used to record action potentials
	from superficial cells of a cat papillary muscle during isometric
	contractions. The muscle was stimulated regularly and test stimuli
	were interpolated at various times between regular (control) responses.
	2. The duration of test action potentials (measured at 80\% repolarization)
	increases exponentially with time as the interval between the test
	stimulus and the preceeding stimulus is increased and a curve drawn
	through the data reaches a plateau at test intervals of 1.0-1.5 s.
	This curve is considered to reflect the time course with which membrane
	conductances return to their pre-stimulus values after a control
	response, and it is known as the 'electrical restitution curve'.
	3. At much longer test intervals the action potential duration duration
	increases again and it approaches the rested state value of about
	0.5 s when the interval between stimuli is 200-300 s. 4. Interventions
	that raise the peak tension developed in isometric contractions,
	such as an increase in the rate of stimulation or in the bathing
	calcium concentration, displace the electrical restitution curve
	downwards (to shorter action potential durations) and to the left
	(to shorter stimulus intervals). This shift in the curve is accompanied
	by a reduction in its magnitude (i.e. the difference in duration
	between the earliest possible action potential and the plateau value),
	but the interventions differ in their effects on the time course
	of electrical restitution: an increase in stimulus frequency causes
	a marked slowing, whereas an increase in bathing calcium concentration
	produces a slight speeding up of its time course. 5. The reduction
	in action potential duration produced by an increase in stimulus
	frequency (rate-dependent shortening) can be separated into two components,
	one resulting from the downward displacement of the electrical restitution
	curve and the other depending on the time available between consecutive
	responses for membrane recovery. The second component becomes increasingly
	important at stimulus frequencies above 100 min-1. 6. Changes in
	action potential duration observed during the tension staircases
	produced by regular stimulation of a rested preparation and by paired
	pulse stimulation can also be accounted for by interaction of downward
	displacement of the electrical restitution curve and variations in
	the degree of recovery of the membrane between consecutive responses.
	7. Downward displacement of the electrical restitution curve is thought
	to result from intracellular accumulation of calcium and/or extracellular
	accumulation of potassium, and the available evidence is considered
	to favour the former mechanism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death takes the lives of more than 300
	000 Americans annually. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias occurring
	in individuals with structurally normal hearts account for a subgroup
	of these sudden deaths. The present study describes the genetic basis
	for a new clinical entity characterized by sudden death and short-QT
	intervals in the ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three families with hereditary
	short-QT syndrome and a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias
	and sudden cardiac death were studied. In 2 of them, we identified
	2 different missense mutations resulting in the same amino acid change
	(N588K) in the S5-P loop region of the cardiac IKr channel HERG (KCNH2).
	The mutations dramatically increase IKr, leading to heterogeneous
	abbreviation of action potential duration and refractoriness, and
	reduce the affinity of the channels to IKr blockers. CONCLUSIONS:
	We demonstrate a novel genetic and biophysical mechanism responsible
	for sudden death in infants, children, and young adults caused by
	mutations in KCNH2. The occurrence of sudden cardiac death in the
	first 12 months of life in 2 patients suggests the possibility of
	a link between KCNH2 gain of function mutations and sudden infant
	death syndrome. KCNH2 is the binding target for a wide spectrum of
	cardiac and noncardiac pharmacological compounds. Our findings may
	provide better understanding of drug interaction with KCNH2 and have
	implications for diagnosis and therapy of this and other arrhythmogenic
	diseases.},

	we wanted to investigate if these indicators could be accurately
	determined in VCG derived from standard 12-lead ECG (dVCG). METHODS:
	ECG and VCG recordings from 21 healthy subjects and 20 patients with
	a history of AF were studied. dVCG was calculated from ECG using
	the inverse Dower transform. Following signal averaging of P-waves,
	comparisons were made between VCG and dVCG, where three parameters
	characterizing signal shape and 15 parameters describing the P-wave
	morphology were used to assess the compatibility of the two recording
	techniques. The latter parameters were also used to compare the healthy
	and the AF groups. RESULTS: After transformation, P-wave shape was
	convincingly preserved. P-wave morphology parameters were consistent
	within the respective groups when comparing VCG and dVCG, with better
	preservation observed in the healthy group. CONCLUSION: VCG derived

	were compared to 10 SR recordings and 3 ectopic atrial tachycardia
	(EAT) recordings. The maximum correlation coefficient was used to
	assess similarity between signals, i.e., if they originate from the
	same wavefront. The cumulative time delay, calculated as pairwise
	summation of interelectrode time delays, was used as an indicator
	of activation sequence along the CS. Method validation using SR showed
	right-to-left conduction with high correlations in 8 of 10 recordings
	indicating one single wavefront. EAT recordings showed consistent
	left-to-right conduction with left atrial foci and right-to-left
	with right atrial focus and lower correlations than SR. All 5 AF
	recordings showed predominantly left-to-right conduction direction,
	also with correlations lower than SR. CONCLUSION: (1) Correlation
	function analysis can be used to assess agreement between signals
	and direction of activation spread. (2) Due to the position of CS,
	the results can be used to derive mechanisms of interatrial conduction.

  abstract = {To date, two detailed ionic models of human atrial cell electrophysiology
	have been developed, the Nygren et al. model (NM) and the Courtemanche
	et al. model (CM). Although both models draw from similar experimental
	data, they have vastly different properties. This paper provides
	the first systematic analysis and comparison of the dynamics of these
	models in spatially extended systems including one-dimensional cables
	and rings, two-dimensional sheets, and a realistic three-dimensional
	human atrial geometry. We observe that, as in single cells, the CM
	adapts to rate changes primarily by changes in action potential duration
	(APD) and morphology, while for the NM rate changes affect resting
	membrane potential (RMP) more than APD. The models also exhibit different
	memory properties as assessed through S1-S2 APD and conduction velocity
	(CV) restitution curves with different S1 cycle lengths. Reentrant
	wave dynamics also differ, with the NM exhibiting stable, non-breaking
	spirals and the CM exhibiting frequent transient wave breaks. The
	realistic atrial geometry modifies dynamics in some cases through
	drift, transient pinning, and breakup. Previously proposed modifications
	to represent atrial fibrillation-remodeled electrophysiology produce
	altered dynamics, including reduced rate adaptation and memory for
	both models and conversion to stable reentry for the CM. Furthermore,
	proposed variations to the NM to reproduce action potentials more
	closely resembling those of the CM do not substantially alter the
	underlying dynamics of the model, so that tissue simulations using
	these modifications still behave more like the unmodified NM. Finally,
	interchanging the transmembrane current formulations of the two models
	suggests that currents contribute more strongly to RMP and CV, intracellular
	calcium dynamics primarily determine reentrant wave dynamics, and
	both are important in APD restitution and memory in these models.
	This finding implies that the formulation of intracellular calcium

	myocyte electrophysiology in recent years has led to a proliferation
	of models, including many that model the same animal species and
	specific region of the heart and thus would be expected to have similar
	properties. In this paper we review and compare two recently developed
	mathematical models of the electrophysiology of canine ventricular
	myocytes. To clarify their similarities and differences, we also
	present studies using them in a range of preparations from single
	cells to two-dimensional tissue. The models are compared with each
	other and with new and previously published experimental results
	in terms of a number of their properties, including action potential
	morphologies; transmembrane currents during normal heart rates and
	during alternans; alternans onsets, magnitudes, and cessations; and
	reentry dynamics of spiral waves. Action potential applets and spiral
	wave movies for the two canine ventricular models are available online
	as supplemental material. We find a number of differences between
	the models, including their rate dependence, alternans dynamics,
	and reentry stability, and a number of differences compared with
	experiments. Differences between models of the same species and region
	of the heart are not unique to these canine models. Similar differences
	can be found in the behavior of two models of human ventricular myocytes
	and of human atrial myocytes. We provide several possible explanations
	for the differences observed in models of the same species and region
	of the heart and discuss the implications for the applicability of
	models in addressing questions of mechanism in cardiac electrophysiology.},

  abstract = {Ventricular arrhythmias remain an important cause of morbidity and

	are in general limited to mapping electrical activity on the heart
	surface. Computational models of action potential propagation offer
	a potentially powerful way to study electrical activation and arrhythmias,

	In this paper, we describe a framework for computing action potential
	propagation in which the geometry, electrophysiology and regional
	properties of ventricular myocardium can be specified so that, for
	example, different models for cardiac cellular electrophysiology
	can be used. We have computed action potential propagation during
	both normal beats and re-entry in an anatomically accurate model
	of ventricular geometry. By computing the resultant electric current
	flow in the torso we have also generated simulated ECG signals that
	result from specific activation patterns in the ventricular model.
	Models can be powerful tools for explaining observations, and this

  journal = {Biomed Eng Online},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {54},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regional differences in action potential duration (APD)
	restitution in the heart favour arrhythmias, but the mechanism is
	not well understood. METHODS: We simulated a 150 x 150 mm 2D sheet
	of cardiac ventricular tissue using a simplified computational model.
	We investigated wavebreak and re-entry initiated by an S1S2S3 stimulus
	protocol in tissue sheets with two regions, each with different APD
	restitution. The two regions had a different APD at short diastolic
	interval (DI), but similar APD at long DI. Simulations were performed
	twice; once with both regions having steep (slope > 1), and once
	with both regions having flat (slope < 1) APD restitution. RESULTS:
	Wavebreak and re-entry were readily initiated using the S1S2S3 protocol
	in tissue sheets with two regions having different APD restitution
	properties. Initiation occurred irrespective of whether the APD restitution
	slopes were steep or flat. With steep APD restitution, the range
	of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from 1 ms with
	S1S2 of 250 ms, to 75 ms (S1S2 180 ms). With flat APD restitution,
	the range of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from
	1 ms (S1S2 250 ms), to 21 ms (S1S2 340 ms) and then 11 ms (S1S2 400
	ms). CONCLUSION: Regional differences in APD restitution are an arrhythmogenic
	substrate that can be concealed at normal heart rates. A premature
	stimulus produces regional differences in repolarisation, and a further
	premature stimulus can then result in wavebreak and initiate re-entry.
	This mechanism for initiating re-entry is independent of the steepness
	of the APD restitution curve.},

  abstract = {Computational models of cardiac myocytes are important tools for understanding
	ionic mechanisms of arrhythmia. This work presents a new model of
	the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally
	observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including
	action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and
	accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for
	the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)),
	the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)),
	the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump
	current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We
	found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L)
	and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but
	modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important
	role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited
	role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we
	found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and
	rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast
	rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and
	Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward
	I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK).
	Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic
	basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's
	response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia).
	Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding
	of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular
	simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic
	targets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an effort to build an anatomically and biophysically
	detailed virtual heart, and, although there are models for the atria
	and ventricles, there is no model for the sinoatrial node (SAN).
	For the SAN to show pacemaking and drive atrial muscle, theoretically,
	there should be a gradient in electrical coupling from the center
	to the periphery of the SAN and an interdigitation of SAN and atrial
	cells at the periphery. Any model should include such features. METHODS
	AND RESULTS: Staining of rabbit SAN preparations for histology, middle
	neurofilament, atrial natriuretic peptide, and connexin (Cx) 43 revealed
	multiple cell types within and around the SAN (SAN and atrial cells,
	fibroblasts, and adipocytes). In contrast to atrial cells, all SAN
	cells expressed middle neurofilament (but not atrial natriuretic
	peptide) mRNA and protein. However, 2 distinct SAN cell types were
	observed: cells in the center (leading pacemaker site) were small,
	were organized in a mesh, and did not express Cx43. In contrast,
	cells in the periphery (exit pathway from the SAN) were large, were
	arranged predominantly in parallel, often expressed Cx43, and were
	mixed with atrial cells. An approximately 2.5-million-element array
	model of the SAN and surrounding atrium, incorporating all cell types,
	was constructed. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a 3D anatomically
	detailed mathematical model of the SAN has been constructed, and
	this shows the presence of a specialized interface between the SAN
	and atrial muscle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. A pace mapping technique using body surface potential
	maps (BSPMs) was developed to guide the positioning of an ablation
	catheter at the ventricular insertion point of accessory pathways
	(AP) in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). METHODS
	AND RESULTS. The study was performed on 30 WPW patients. BSPMs were
	recorded with 63 leads distributed over the entire torso surface.
	The catheter used for radiofrequency ablation was first placed in
	the vicinity of the ventricular preexcitation site predicted by BSPMs
	recorded during the delta wave. BSPMs were then recorded during pacing
	with this catheter, the comparison between the preexcited and paced
	BSPMs indicated whether the pacing site was too anterior or posterior
	with respect to the preexcitation site, and the catheter was moved
	accordingly. This process was repeated until the preexcited and paced
	BSPMs were highly correlated (r > or = 0.8), and ablation then was
	attempted. It was possible to successfully ablate the AP in 28 patients
	after an investigation that lasted 54 +/- 44 minutes between the
	recording of the first paced BSPM and that of the BSPM paced at the
	successful ablation site. Patients with left free wall pathways needed
	less investigation time compared with patients with pathways of other
	locations (46 +/- 9 versus 100 +/- 25 minutes, p = 0.031). The sensitivity
	of BSPM pace mapping was assessed using pacing with a multipolar
	catheter, and significant changes were observed on the BSPMs for
	beats with pacing sites that were only 5 mm apart. CONCLUSIONS, BSPM
	pace mapping allowed us to achieve a 93\% success rate with short
	investigation durations, provides significant information that cannot
	be obtained with the standard 12-lead ECG, is a self-correcting procedure
	that reduces the importance of BSPM alterations due to individual
	differences in the shape of the torso or heart, and is applicable
	only to patients with AP showing antegrade conduction.},

  abstract = {Atrial action potential heterogeneity is a major determinant of atrial
	reentrant arrhythmias, but the underlying ionic mechanisms are poorly

	right atrial repolarization, we isolated cells from 4 regions: the
	crista terminalis (CT), appendage (APG), atrioventricular ring (AVR)
	area, and pectinate muscles. Systematic action potential (AP) differences
	were noted: CT cells had a "spike-and-dome" morphology and the longest
	AP duration (APD; value to 95\% repolarization at 1 Hz, 270+/-10
	ms [mean+/-SEM]); APG and pectinate muscle cells had intermediate
	APDs (180+/-3 and 190+/-3 ms, respectively; P<0.001 versus CT for
	each), with APG cells having a small phase 1; and AVR cells had the
	shortest APD (160+/-4 ms, P<0.001 versus other regions). The inward
	rectifier and the slow and ultrarapid delayed rectifier currents
	were similar in all regions. The transient outward K+ current was
	significantly smaller in APG cells, explaining their small phase
	1 and high plateau. L-type Ca2+ current was greatest in CT cells
	and least in AVR cells, contributing to their longer and shorter
	APD, respectively. The E-4031-sensitive rapid delayed rectifier K+
	current was larger in AVR cells compared with other regions. Voltage-
	and time-dependent current properties were constant across regions.
	We conclude that myocytes from different right atrial regions of
	the dog show systematic variations in AP properties and ionic currents
	and that the spatial variation in ionic current density may explain
	AP differences. Regional variation in atrial ionic currents may play
	an important role in atrial arrhythmia generation and may present
	opportunities for improving antiarrhythmic drug therapy.},

  abstract = {It has become widely accepted that the most dangerous cardiac arrhythmias
	are due to reentrant waves, i.e., electrical wave(s) that recirculate
	repeatedly throughout the tissue at a higher frequency than the waves
	produced by the heart's natural pacemaker (sinoatrial node). However,
	the complicated structure of cardiac tissue, as well as the complex
	ionic currents in the cell, have made it extremely difficult to pinpoint
	the detailed dynamics of these life-threatening reentrant arrhythmias.
	A simplified ionic model of the cardiac action potential (AP), which
	can be fitted to a wide variety of experimentally and numerically
	obtained mesoscopic characteristics of cardiac tissue such as AP
	shape and restitution of AP duration and conduction velocity, is
	used to explain many different mechanisms of spiral wave breakup
	which in principle can occur in cardiac tissue. Some, but not all,
	of these mechanisms have been observed before using other models;
	therefore, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate them using
	just one framework model and to explain the different parameter regimes
	or physiological properties necessary for each mechanism (such as
	high or low excitability, corresponding to normal or ischemic tissue,
	spiral tip trajectory types, and tissue structures such as rotational
	anisotropy and periodic boundary conditions). Each mechanism is compared
	with data from other ionic models or experiments to illustrate that
	they are not model-specific phenomena. Movies showing all the breakup
	mechanisms are available at http://arrhythmia.hofstra.edu/breakup
	and at ftp://ftp.aip.org/epaps/chaos/E-CHAOEH-12-039203/ INDEX.html.
	The fact that many different breakup mechanisms exist has important

	uncoupling drugs, and initiation protocols. (c) 2002 American Institute

  abstract = {Action potential repolarization in the mammalian heart is governed
	by interactions of a number of time- and voltage-dependent channel-mediated
	currents, as well as contributions from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and
	the Na+/K+ pump. Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents
	(HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle
	is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant
	functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity
	of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological
	agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus
	for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others
	have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+
	currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle.
	Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two
	K+ currents, IK1 and HERG (or IK,r), within the framework of ten
	Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this
	computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear
	K+ conductances, IK1 and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental
	data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human
	ventricular tissue and/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model
	provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time
	courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new
	formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s)
	of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle.
	Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the

	conduction velocity (CV) restitution properties of rapid-pacing-induced
	electrically remodelled sheep atria and healthy atria, respectively.
	The models were tested by inducing reentry in a two-dimensional anisotropic

	CLs. RESULTS: Parameters for the FK models were obtained that reproduced
	APD and CV restitution properties measured in the CAF and healthy

	The FK-CAF model is shown to approximate the restitution properties

	and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).
	Several methods exist to enhance sensitivity and specificity of resting
	ECG for diagnosis of CAD, but such methods are not better than a
	specialist's judgement. We compared a new computer-enhanced, resting
	ECG analysis device, 3DMP, to coronary angiography to evaluate the
	device's accuracy in detecting hemodynamically relevant CAD. METHODS:
	A convenience sample of 423 patients without prior coronary revascularization
	was evaluated with 3DMP before coronary angiography. 3DMP's sensitivity
	and specificity in detecting hemodynamically relevant coronary stenosis
	as diagnosed with coronary angiography were calculated as well as
	odds ratios for the 3DMP severity score and coronary artery disease
	risk factors. RESULTS: 3DMP identified 179 of 201 patients with hemodynamically
	relevant stenosis (sensitivity 89.1\%, specificity 81.1\%). The positive
	and negative predictive values for identification of coronary stenosis
	as diagnosed in coronary angiograms were 79\% and 90\% respectively.
	CAD risk factors in a logistic regression model had markedly lower
	predictive power for the presence of coronary stenosis in patients
	than did 3DMP severity score (odds ratio 3.35 [2.24-5.01] vs. 34.87
	[20.00-60.79]). Logistic regression combining severity score with
	risk factors did not add significantly to the prediction quality
	(odds ratio 36.73 [20.92-64.51]). CONCLUSIONS: 3DMP's computer-based,
	mathematically derived analysis of resting two-lead ECG data provides
	detection of hemodynamically relevant CAD with high sensitivity and
	specificity that appears to be at least as good as those reported
	for other resting and/or stress ECG methods currently used in clinical

  abstract = {AIMS: Although the perpetuation of several supraventricular arrhythmias
	is critically dependent upon intra-atrial conduction, the literature
	lacks detailed information on normal values of conduction velocity
	and degree of anisotropy. In order to explore these factors further,
	we have measured conduction velocities at the right atrial free wall
	during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing in four directions parallel
	and perpendicular to the atrioventricular groove in patients with
	normal atria and stable sinus rhythm. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using
	a Bard Cardiac Mapping System, atrial ECGs were recorded using a
	3 x 4 cm electrode array with 56 equally spaced bipolar electrodes
	in 12 patients undergoing open heart surgery due to ischaemic heart
	disease or Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. A bipolar pen probe connected
	to a Medtronic 5328 stimulator was used for pacing at a 10\% higher
	rate than sinus rhythm. The local activation times were manually
	set and isochronal activation maps were created for each recording.
	The conduction velocities were calculated from the activation maps
	over a distance ranging from 2.2 to 4.2 cm. The majority of the activation
	maps showed no signs of anisotropy; the others had less than 15\%
	spatial inhomogeneity of conduction. Mean conduction velocity, calculated
	from five consecutive beats, was 88 +/- 9 cm.s-1 (mean +/- SD), ranging
	between 68 +/- 4 and 103 +/- 3 cm.s-1 during sinus rhythm. Mean conduction
	velocity during atrial pacing was 81 +/- 16 cm.s-1 at a propagation
	direction of 0 degree, 74 +/- 14 cm.s-1 at a 90 degrees direction,
	79 +/- 12 cm.s-1 at 180 degrees and 78 +/- 20 cm.s-1 at 270 degrees,
	where 0 degree was parallel to the atrioventricular groove in the
	cranial direction and the angle increased counter-clockwise. Mean
	conduction velocity during sinus rhythm was significantly higher
	(P < 0.05) than during atrial pacing at the 90 degrees and 180 degrees
	directions but not compared to atrial pacing at 0 degree or 270 degrees.
	There was no significant difference in mean conduction velocity in
	different directions during atrial pacing. CONCLUSION: Although anisotropy
	was documented during conduction velocity in individual cases, conduction
	velocity was not dependent on propagation direction at the epicardial
	right atrial free wall in patients with stable sinus rhythm. These
	findings do not exclude the presence of internodal preferential pathways
	as these are located sub-epicardially and a marked transmural discordance
	in activation has previously been documented in the vicinity of such
	pathways.},

	process of wavefront propagation and arrhythmogenesis in human atria,
	technical concerns and issues of patient safety have limited experimental
	investigations. The present work describes a finite volume-based
	computer model of human atrial activation and current flow to complement
	these studies. Unlike previous representations, the model is three-dimensional,
	incorporating both the left and right atria and the major muscle
	bundles of the atria, including the crista terminalis, pectinate
	muscles, limbus of the fossa ovalis, and Bachmann's bundle. The bundles
	are represented as anisotropic structures with fiber directions aligned
	with the bundle axes. Conductivities are assigned to the model to
	give realistic local conduction velocities within the bundles and
	bulk tissue. Results from simulations demonstrate the role of the
	bundles in a normal sinus rhythm and also reveal the patterns of
	activation in the septum, where experimental mapping has been extremely
	challenging. To validate the model, the simulated normal activation
	sequence and conduction velocities at various locations are compared
	with experimental observations and data. The model is also used to
	investigate paced activation, and a mechanism of the relative lengthening
	of left versus right stimulation is presented. Owing to both the
	realistic geometry and the bundle structures, the model can be used
	for further analysis of the normal activation sequence and to examine
	abnormal conduction, including flutter. The full text of this article

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously documented significant differences
	in orthogonal P wave morphology between patients with and without
	paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). However, there exists little
	data concerning normal P wave morphology. This study was aimed at
	exploring orthogonal P wave morphology and its variations in healthy
	subjects. METHODS: 120 healthy volunteers were included, evenly distributed
	in decades from 20-80 years of age; 60 men (age 50+/-17) and 60 women
	(50+/-16). Six-minute long 12-lead ECG registrations were acquired
	and transformed into orthogonal leads. Using a previously described
	P wave triggered P wave signal averaging method we were able to compare
	similarities and differences in P wave morphologies. RESULTS: Orthogonal
	P wave morphology in healthy individuals was predominately positive
	in Leads X and Y. In Lead Z, one third had negative morphology and
	two-thirds a biphasic one with a transition from negative to positive.
	The latter P wave morphology type was significantly more common after
	the age of 50 (P < 0.01). P wave duration (PWD) increased with age
	being slightly longer in subjects older than 50 (121+/-13 ms vs.
	128+/-12 ms, P < 0.005). Minimal intraindividual variation of P wave
	morphology was observed. CONCLUSION: Changes of signal averaged orthogonal
	P wave morphology (biphasic signal in Lead Z), earlier reported in
	PAF patients, are common in healthy subjects and appear predominantly
	after the age of 50. Subtle age-related prolongation of PWD is unlikely
	to be sufficient as a sole explanation of this finding that is thought
	to represent interatrial conduction disturbances. To serve as future
	reference, P wave morphology parameters of the healthy subjects are
	provided.},

	Understanding the gross structure, and the myoarchitecture, of the
	atriums is fundamental to investigations into the substrates and
	therapy of atrial fibrillation. Based primarily on our experience
	with normal human hearts, this review provides, firstly, a basis
	of comparison of gross structures as seen in the clinical situation,

	discuss the general arrangement of myocardial fibres with respect
	to gross topography in the normal human heart. The right atrium is
	dominated by an extensive array of pectinate muscles within the extensive
	appendage, whereas the left atrium is relatively smooth-walled, with
	a much smaller tubular appendage. Myoarchitecture displays parallel
	alignment of fibres along distinct muscle bundles, such as the terminal
	crest and Bachmann's bundle. Within the smooth wall of the left atrium,
	there is a marked transmural change in the orientation of the muscular
	fibres. Abrupt changes in orientation, and mixed arrangements, are
	common between bundles. Other than Bachmann's bundle, the muscular
	bridges which provide interatrial connections, and connections between
	the left atrium and the coronary sinus and inferior caval vein, are
	highly variable. Inhomogeneities both in gross structure and myoarchitecture
	are common in the normal heart. These should be taken into account

	of standard 12-lead ECG. Unfiltered signal-averaged P waves were

	site was the fossa ovalis in 8 patients, Bachmann bundle in 18, and
	coronary sinus in 2. Type 1 P-wave morphology was observed in 9 patients,

	Twelve-lead ECG recordings (1 kHz sampling frequency, 0.625 microV
	resolution) from 131 healthy subjects were used. Orthogonal leads
	were derived using the inverse Dower transform. Magnification (100
	times), baseline filtering (0.5 Hz high-pass and 50 Hz bandstop filters),
	signal averaging (10 seconds) and bandpass filtering (40-250 Hz)
	were used to investigate the effect of methodology on the estimated
	P wave duration. Unfiltered, signal averaged P wave analysis was
	performed to determine the required recording length (6 minutes to
	10 s) and the reproducibility of the P wave morphology classification
	procedure. Manual classification was carried out by two experts on
	two separate occasions each. The performance of the automated classification
	algorithm was evaluated using the joint decision of the two experts
	(i.e., the consensus of the two experts). RESULTS: The estimate of
	the P wave duration increased in each step as a result of magnification,
	baseline filtering and averaging (100 +/- 18 vs. 131 +/- 12 ms; P
	< 0.0001). The estimate of the duration of the bandpass-filtered
	P wave was dependent on the noise cut-off value: 119 +/- 15 ms (0.2
	microV), 138 +/- 13 ms (0.1 microV) and 143 +/- 18 ms (0.05 microV).
	(P = 0.01 for all comparisons).The mean errors associated with the
	P wave morphology parameters were comparable in all segments analysed
	regardless of recording length (95\% limits of agreement within 0
	+/- 20\% (mean +/- SD)). The results of the 6-min analyses were comparable
	to those obtained at the other recording lengths (6 min to 10 s).The
	intra-rater classification reproducibility was 96\%, while the interrater
	reproducibility was 94\%. The automated classification algorithm
	agreed with the manual classification in 90\% of the cases. CONCLUSION:
	The methodology used has profound effects on the estimation of P
	wave duration, and the method used must therefore be validated before
	any inferences can be made about P wave duration. This has implications
	in the interpretation of multiple studies where P wave duration is
	assessed, and conclusions with respect to normal values are drawn.P
	wave morphology and duration assessed using unfiltered, signal-averaged
	P wave analysis have high reproducibility, which is unaffected by
	the length of the recording. In the present study, the performance
	of the proposed automated classification algorithm, providing total
	reproducibility, showed excellent agreement with manually defined
	P wave morphologies.},

	of delivery that was prompted by bradycardia and irregular rythm.
	ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and
	short QT interval. Genetic analysis identified a de novo missense
	mutation in the potassium channel KCNQ1 (V141M). To characterize
	the physiological consequences of the V141M mutation, Xenopus laevis
	oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding wild-type (wt) KCNQ1 or
	mutant V141M KCNQ1 subunits, with or without KCNE1. RESULTS: Ionic
	currents were recorded using standard two-microelectrode voltage
	clamp techniques. In the absence of KCNE1, wtKCNQ1 and V141M KCNQ1
	currents had similar biophysical properties. Coexpression of wtKCNQ1+KCNE1
	subunits induced the typical slowly activating and voltage-dependent
	delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Ks). In contrast, oocytes injected
	with cRNA encoding V141M KCNQ1+KCNE1 subunits exhibited an instantaneous
	and voltage-independent K(+)-selective current. Coexpression of V141M
	and wtKCNQ1 with KCNE1 induced a current with intermediate biophysical
	properties. Computer modeling showed that the mutation would shorten
	action potential duration of human ventricular myocytes and abolish
	pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node. CONCLUSIONS: The description
	of a novel, de novo gain of function mutation in KCNQ1, responsible
	for atrial fibrillation and short QT syndrome in utero indicates
	that some of these cases may have a genetic basis and confirms a
	previous hypothesis that gain of function mutations in KCNQ1 channels

	geometry and composition affect the extracorporal magnetic field
	produced by a current dipole in the centre of the ventricular mass.
	The magnetic induction vector B arising from the dipole has been
	calculated at points of a precordial measuring grid and the influence
	of boundaries has been assessed qualitatively, by comparing contour
	maps of the B component normal to the torso's frontal plane. We found
	that the maps reflected relatively faithfully the underlying dipolar
	source for the homogeneous torso and even for the torso with lungs.
	However, the intraventricular blood masses caused a noticeable rotation
	of the maps' extrema. Both lungs and blood masses tended to swing
	the distribution towards the distribution that would have been caused
	by a dipole oriented along the anatomical axis of the heart.},

	instigating atrial fibrillation is the myocardial tissue, or sleeves,
	at the base of the pulmonary veins. This Study compared the properties

	with cells front the normal cardiac pacemaker (the sinoatrial node)
	and regions of the atria. Our objective was to identify key features
	of these cells that predispose them to becoming of focus of cardiac
	arrhythmias. Methods and Results-Single cells were isolated front
	samples of rabbit PVm, central and peripheral sinoatrial node, crista
	terminalis, and left and right atria. Detailed morphology of cells
	was assessed and intracellular calcium concentrations measured with
	the use of Fluo-3. Cells from the PVm were smaller than atrial cells
	and showed large elevations in diastolic Calcium during activation
	at physiological rates, a feature the PVm cells shared with cells
	from the sinoatrial node. Unstimulated spontaneous activity was observed
	in a minority of cells front the PVm, but numerous cells from this
	region showed spontaneous activity for a brief period immediately
	subsequent to stimulation at physiological rates. This was not observed
	in atrial cells. Assessment of calcium removal pathways showed sarcoemmal
	calcium extrusion in cells from the PVm to have a high reliance oil
	``slow{''} extrusion pathways to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis
	because of a low expression of sodium-calcium exchanger. Conclusions-We
	conclude that cells from the PVm share some features with cells from
	the sinoatrial node but also have distinctly unique features that
	predispose them to the development of spontaneous activity. (Circ

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The complexity of ablation for atrial macroreentry atrial
	flutter (AFL) varies significantly depending on the circuit location.
	Presently, surface electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis poorly separates
	left from right atypical AFL and from some cases of typical AFL,
	which delays diagnosis until invasive study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose
	of this study was to differentiate and localize the intra-atrial
	circuits of left atypical AFL, right atypical, and typical AFL using
	quantitative ECG analysis. METHODS: We studied 66 patients (54 men,
	age 59 +/- 14 years) with typical (n = 35), reverse typical (n =
	4), and atypical (n = 27) AFL. For each, we generated filtered atrial
	waveforms from ECG leads V5 (X-axis), aVF (Y-axis), and V1 (Z-axis)
	by correlating a 120-ms F-wave sample to successive ECG regions.
	Atrial spatial loops were plotted for three orthogonal planes (frontal,
	XY = V5/aVF; sagittal, YZ = aVF/V1; axial, XZ = V5/V1) and then cross-correlated
	to measure spatial regularity (i.e., coherence; range -1 to 1). RESULTS:
	Mean coherence was greatest in the XY plane (P <10(-3) vs. XZ or
	YZ). Atypical AFL showed lower coherence than typical AFL in the
	XY (P <10(-3)), YZ (P <10(-6)), and XZ (P <10(-5)) planes. Atypical
	left AFL could be separated from atypical right AFL by lower XY coherence
	(P = .02); for this plane, coherence <0.69 detected atypical left
	AFL with 84\% specificity and 75\% sensitivity. F-wave amplitude
	alone did not separate typical, atypical right, or atypical left
	AFL (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical AFL shows lower spatial coherence
	than typical AFL, particularly in the sagittal and axial planes.
	Coherence in the Cartesian frontal plane separated left and right
	atypical AFL. Such analyses may be used to plan ablation strategy
	from the bedside.},

	Spiral breakup is found to occur when the minimum period T(min),
	below which a periodically stimulated tissue exhibits alternans in
	action potential duration, exceeds by a finite amount the spiral
	rotation period T(S). At this point, oscillations in action potential
	duration are of sufficiently large amplitude to cause a spontaneous
	conduction block to form along the wavefront. The latter occurs closer
	to the initiation point of reentry (spiral tip) with increasing steepness
	and, hence, in smaller tissue sizes. Spiral breakup leads to a spatially
	disorganized wave activity which is always transient, except for
	tissues larger than some minimum size and within a very narrow range

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been linked to increased inward rectifier
	potassium current, I(K1), either due to AF-induced electrical remodelling,
	or from functional changes due to the Kir2.1 V93I mutation. The aim
	of this simulation study was to identify at cell and tissue levels'
	mechanisms by which increased I(K1) facilitates and perpetuates AF.
	The Courtemanche et al. human atrial cell action potential (AP) model
	was modified to incorporate reported changes in I(K1) induced by
	the Kir2.1 V93I mutation in both heterozygous (Het) and homozygous
	(Hom) mutant forms. The modified models for wild type (WT), Het and
	Hom conditions were incorporated into homogeneous 1D, 2D and 3D tissue
	models. Restitution curves of AP duration (APD), effective refractory
	period (ERP) and conduction velocity (CV) were computed and both
	the temporal and the spatial vulnerability of atrial tissue to re-entry
	were measured. The lifespan and tip meandering pattern of re-entry
	were also characterised. For comparison, parallel simulations were
	performed by incorporating into the Courtmanche et al. model a linear
	increase in maximal I(K1) conductance. It was found that the gain-in-function
	of V93I 'mutant'I(K1) led to abbreviated atrial APs and flattened
	APD, ERP and CV restitution curves. It also hyperpolarised atrial
	resting membrane potential and slowed down intra-atrial conduction.
	V93I 'mutant'I(K1) reduced the tissue's temporal vulnerability but
	increased spatial vulnerability to initiate and sustain re-entry,
	resulting in an increased overall susceptibility of atrial tissue
	to arrhythmogenesis. In the 2D model, spiral waves self-terminated
	for WT (lifespan < 3.3 s) tissue, but persisted in Het and Hom tissues
	for the whole simulation period (lifespan > 10 s). The tip of the
	spiral wave meandered more in WT tissue than in Het and Hom tissues.
	Increased I(K1) due to augmented maximal conductance produced similar
	results to those of Het and Hom Kir2.1 V93I mutant conditions. In
	the 3D model the dynamic behaviour of scroll waves was stabilized
	by increased I(K1). In conclusion, increased I(K1) current, either
	by the Kir2.1 V93I mutation or by augmented maximal conductance,
	increases atrial susceptibility to arrhythmia by increasing the lifespan
	of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D
	tissue, thereby facilitating initiation and maintenance of re-entrant

	of the P-wave morphology (PWM) in focal atrial tachycardia (AT) and
	construct and prospectively evaluate an algorithm for identification
	of the anatomic site of origin. BACKGROUND: Although smaller studies
	have described the PWM from particular anatomic locations, a detailed
	algorithm characterizing the likely location of a tachycardia associated
	with a P-wave of unknown origin has been lacking. METHODS: The PWMs
	for 126 consecutive patients undergoing successful radiofrequency
	ablation of 130 ATs are reported. P waves were included only when
	the onset was preceded by a discernible isoelectric segment. P waves
	were classified as positive (+), negative (-), isoelectric, or biphasic.
	Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated.
	On the basis of these results, an algorithm was constructed and prospectively
	evaluated in 30 new consecutive ATs. RESULTS: The distribution of
	ATs was right atrial (RA) in 82 of 130 (63\%) and left atrial (LA)
	in 48 of 130 (37\%). Right atrial sites included crista (n = 28),
	tricuspid annulus (n = 29), coronary sinus (CS) ostium (n = 14),
	perinodal (n = 7), right septum (n = 1), and RA appendage (n= 3).
	Left atrial sites included pulmonary veins (n = 32), mitral annulus
	(n = 8), CS body (n= 3), left septum (n = 3), and LA appendage (n
	= 2). In electrocardiographic lead V1, a negative or +/- P-wave demonstrated
	a specificity of 100\% for a RA focus, and a + or -/+ P-wave demonstrated
	a sensitivity of 100\% for a LA focus. A characteristic PWM was associated
	with high sensitivity and specificity at common atrial sites for
	tachycardia foci. A P-wave algorithm correctly identified the focus
	in 93\%. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic PWMs corresponding to known
	anatomic sites for focal AT are associated with high specificity

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of selected inhomogeneities
	and anisotropies on computed electric potential fields associated
	with the electrocardiographic forward problem. The model construction
	was based on the Utah Torso model and included geometry for major
	anatomical structures such as subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle,
	and lungs, as well as for epicardial fatpads, major arteries and
	veins, and the sternum, ribs, spine, and clavicles. Measured epicardial
	potentials served as the electrical source for solutions to the electrocardiographic
	forward problems computed using the finite element method (FEM).
	The geometry of the torso model for each simulation was constant,
	but different combinations of conductivities were assigned to individual
	organs or tissues. Comparisons of different conductivity combinations
	followed one of two basic schemes: 1) a homogeneous torso served
	as the reference against which we compared simulations with a single
	organ or tissue and assigned its nominal conductivity, or 2) a fully
	inhomogeneous torso served as the reference and we removed the effect
	of individual organs or tissues by assigning it the homogeneous conductivity
	value. When single inhomogeneities were added to an otherwise homogeneous
	isotropic model, anisotropic skeletal muscle (at a 15:1 anisotropy
	ratio) and the right and left lung had larger average effects (12.8,
	12.7, and 12.1\% relative error (RE), respectively) than the other
	inhomogeneities tested. Our results for removing single inhomogeneities
	show that the subcutaneous fat, the anisotropic skeletal muscle (with
	the degree of anisotropy equal to 7:1), and the lungs have larger
	average impacts on the body surface potential distributions than
	other elements of the model (with values of 14.9, 12.6, and 11.7\%
	RE, respectively). The results also show that the size of the effect
	depended strongly on the distribution of epicardial potentials. The
	results of this study suggest that accurate representation of tissue
	inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the accuracy of the forward
	solution, with regions near the torso surface playing a larger role,
	in general, than those near the heart.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is thought to be due
	to multiple, simultaneously circulating wavelets. In the canine sterile
	pericarditis model, the mechanisms of maintenance of AF are not yet
	understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: During six induced AF episodes in
	six dogs with sterile pericarditis, 372 unipolar electrograms were
	recorded simultaneously from an electrode array placed around both
	atrial free walls, along with 10 to 24 electrodes from the atrial
	septum, by use of a multiplexing system. Activation maps during 12
	consecutive 100-ms windows were analyzed from an episode of sustained
	AF in each dog (mean duration, 32 +/- 24 minutes). In two dogs, two
	such activation maps during the same episode of AF were analyzed.
	During AF, multiple unstable reentrant circuits (mean number, 1.4
	+/- 0.1 per 100-ms analysis window) with very short cycle lengths
	(mean, 111 +/- 8 ms) present primarily in the atrial septum and right
	atrium were responsible for maintenance of AF. The unstable reentrant
	circuits frequently disappeared and re-formed. Wave fronts traveling
	from one atrium to the other and/or from the atrial septum play an
	important role in re-formation of unstable reentrant wave fronts.
	CONCLUSIONS: In this model of paroxysmal AF, unstable reentrant circuits
	of very short cycle length principally involving the atrial septum
	appear to be critical for maintenance of AF. Some reentrant circuits
	disappear as others re-form, so that at least one reentrant circuit
	is always present. Because the atria cannot follow their very short
	cycle lengths in a 1:1 manner, AF is maintained.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relative contribution of the atrial septum and interatrial
	connections to biatrial activation is a fundamental concept of human
	cardiac electrophysiology that has yet to be fully characterized.
	The purpose of the present study was to determine how both atria
	are coupled electrically. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients (16
	men; mean age 54+/-11years) with a history of symptomatic atrial
	fibrillation (AF) underwent simultaneous biatrial noncontact mapping
	before catheter ablation of AF. The multiple electrode array catheters
	were positioned, respectively, in the left atrium (LA; transseptally)
	and the right atrium (RA). In all but 2 patients, isopotential maps
	revealed that endocardial septal activations of the RA and LA were
	separate, independent, and asynchronous of each other. Interatrial
	conduction was related to the site of initial atrial depolarization,
	revealing conduction over Bachmann's bundle in all patients during
	sinus rhythm, high RA pacing, and pacing from the LA appendage. Pacing
	from the coronary sinus was associated with conduction over the interatrial
	connection at the level of the coronary sinus in all patients, and
	conduction over Bachmann's bundle also occurred in 5 (26\%) of 19
	patients. Interatrial conduction over the fossa ovalis occurred in
	only 2 (2\%) of the 116 segments analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Electrical
	coupling of the RA and LA in humans is predominantly provided by
	muscular connections at the level of Bachmann's bundle and the coronary
	sinus. The true septum (the fossa ovalis and its limbus) of the RA
	and LA is asynchronous and discordant, usually without contralateral
	conduction during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing.},

	(10 microM); neither was it inhibited by hyperosmolar external solution

	of volume-sensitive anion channels. I(ANION) was partially inhibited
	by the Cl(-) channel blockers NPPB (50 microM) and Gly H-101 (30
	microM). Incorporation of I(ANION) into a human atrial action potential
	(AP) simulation led to depression of the AP plateau, accompanied

	atrial depolarization under sinus rhythm in 8 healthy male subjects.
	For each subject, 95 unipolar disk electrodes with inter-electrode
	distance of 2 cm were used to record simultaneously potential ECGs
	over the anterior chest. The Laplacian ECG was then estimated during
	the P wave using a novel spline Laplacian technique. The body surface
	potential map (BSPM) and body surface Laplacian map (BSLM) at different
	time instants or time intervals of the P wave were constructed and
	compared. The present results showed that the BSPMs during the P
	wave were characterized by the rotation of a pair of positive/negative
	potential distribution from right to left around the anterior torso.
	On the other hand, the corresponding BSLMs revealed more spatial
	details, including two positive activities (denoted as P1 and P2,
	appeared in all 8 subjects), and three negative activities (denoted
	as N1, N2, and N3, appeared in 7, 7, and 4 subjects, respectively).
	The separation of these activities and their evolving patterns were

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The patterns of activation of the human left atrium (LA),
	how they relate to atrial myocardial architecture, and their role
	in arrhythmogenesis remain largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS:
	Left atrial endocardial activation was mapped in 19 patients with
	a percutaneous noncontact mapping system. Earliest endocardial breakthrough
	during sinus rhythm (SR) occurred more frequently in the septal (63\%,
	principally posteroseptal) than anterosuperior (37\%) LA and varied
	little with isoproterenol or high right atrial pacing rate. Regardless
	of site of breakthrough, LA activation was characterized in all patients
	by propagation around a variably complete line of functional conduction
	block, descending on the posterior wall from the roof, passing between
	the ostia of the superior and then inferior pulmonary veins (PVs)
	before turning septally, passing below the oval fossa, and merging
	further anteriorly with the septal mitral annulus. Examination of
	the myocardial architecture in 10 normal adult postmortem hearts
	revealed an abrupt change in subendocardial fiber orientation along
	a line following the same course. During episodes of focal initiation
	of atrial fibrillation (AF), interaction was observed between wavefronts
	entering the LA from PVs and this functional line of conduction block
	that resulted in LA macroreentry or formation of daughter wavefronts.
	CONCLUSIONS: The LA endocardium has complex but characteristic patterns
	of activation during sinus rhythm, pacing, and AF initiation by PV
	ectopy that are determined largely by the functional properties of
	atrial musculature. These findings have important implications for
	both pacing and ablative strategies for the prevention of initiation
	of AF.},

	METHODS AND RESULTS: We created MI in 8 dogs by permanent occlusion
	of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Seven dogs
	(3 with thoracotomy) that had no LAD occlusion served as controls.
	Eight weeks after surgery, the incidence and duration of pacing-induced
	AF in the open chest anesthetized state were significantly (P<0.05)
	higher in the MI than in control dogs. Multisite biatrial monophasic
	action potential (MAP) recordings showed increased heterogeneity
	of MAP duration (MAPD) and MAPD restitution slope. AF in the MI groups
	was preceded by significantly higher MAPD (P<0.01) and MAP amplitude
	(P<0.05) alternans in both atria compared with controls. Epicardial
	mapping using 1792 bipolar electrodes (1-mm spatial resolution) showed
	multisite wavebreaks of the paced wavefronts leading to AF in MI
	but not in control dogs. Multiple wavelets in MI dogs were associated
	with significantly higher incidence and longer duration of AF compared
	with control. The density of biatrial tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
	growth-associated protein43 (GAP43) nerves were 5- to 8-fold higher
	and were more heterogeneous in MI compared with control dogs. CONCLUSIONS:
	Chronic ventricular MI with no atrial involvement causes heterogeneous
	alteration of atrial electrical restitution and atrial sympathetic
	hyperinnervation that might provide important substrates for the

	circuit for the sarcolemma, coupled with a fluid compartment model,
	which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm
	as well as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This formulation can reconstruct
	action potential data that are representative of recordings from
	a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore
	provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic currents.
	This work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial
	myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in
	some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit atrium.
	We have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward
	K+ current (I[sus]), which putatively has a prominent role in determining
	the duration of the human atrial action potential. Our results demonstrate
	that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases
	is determined primarily by transient outward K+ current, I(sus) and
	L-type Ca2+ current (I[Ca,L]) and that the role of I(sus) in the
	human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes
	of I(Ca,L), I(sus) and the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current. As
	a result, our simulations suggest that the functional role of I(sus)
	can depend on the physiological/disease state of the cell.},

	using an idealized strand of human atrial cells. Elevated [K+]o in
	the 5-20 mM range shifts the resting potential (Vrest) in the depolarizing
	direction and reduces input resistance (Rin) by increasing an inwardly
	rectifying K+ conductance, I(Kl). Our results show that in this model:
	(1) theta depends on [K+]o in a "biphasic" fashion. Moderate elevations
	of [K+]o (to less than 8 mM) result in a small increase in theta,
	whereas at higher [K+]o (8-16 mM) theta is reduced. (2) This biphasic
	relationship can be attributed to the competing effects of (i) the
	smaller depolarization needed to reach the excitation threshold (Vthresh-Vrest)
	and (ii) reduced availability (increased inactivation) of sodium
	current, INa, as the cell depolarizes progressively. (3) Decreasing
	Rin reduces theta due to the increased electrical load on surrounding
	cells. (4) The effect on theta of [K+]o-induced changes in Rin in
	the atrium (as well as other high-Rin tissue, such as that of the
	Purkinje system or nodes) is likely to be small. This effect could
	be substantial, however, under conditions in which Rin is comparable

	are based on very similar data, they can result in some apparently
	contradictory findings, some of which are of fundamental importance
	to human atrial electrophysiology and pharmacology. In particular,
	simulations with these two models have given rise to different conclusions
	regarding the role of the rapidly activating sustained outward K
	current, , in determining the action–potential duration. Different
	conclusions regarding the rate dependence of the action potential

	two models in an attempt to determine the reasons for these discrepancies.
	The individual ion current characterizations are quite similar in
	the two models. The primary difference between the models is in the
	assumed baseline actionpotential shape, and therefore the sizes of
	the underlying ionic currents. The duration of spike–and–dome–type
	action potentials, which rely mainly on the delayed rectifier currents,
	and , for final repolarization, is relatively insensitive to block
	of . In contrast,triangular action potentials are prolonged substantially
	by block, since they rely more on for final repolarization. The rate–dependent
	properties of spike–and–dome action potentials can be explained in
	terms of their larger (L–type calcium current), and currents.},

	disorder, causes heart failure and rhythm disturbances. The majority
	of identified DCM genes encode structural proteins of the contractile
	apparatus and cytoskeleton. Recently, genetic defects in calcium
	and potassium regulation have been discovered in patients with DCM,
	implicating an alternative disease mechanism. The full spectrum of
	genetic defects in DCM, however, has not been established. OBJECTIVES:
	To identify a novel gene for DCM at a previously mapped locus, define
	the spectrum of mutations in this gene within a DCM cohort, and determine
	the frequency of DCM among relatives inheriting a mutation in this
	gene. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Refined mapping of a DCM
	locus on chromosome 3p in a multigenerational family and mutation
	scanning in 156 unrelated probands with DCM, prospectively identified
	at the Mayo Clinic between 1987 and 2004. Relatives underwent screening
	echocardiography and electrocardiography and DNA sample procurement.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation of identified mutations with cardiac
	phenotype. RESULTS: Refined locus mapping revealed SCN5A, encoding
	the cardiac sodium channel, as a candidate gene. Mutation scans identified
	a missense mutation (D1275N) that cosegregated with an age-dependent,
	variably expressed phenotype of DCM, atrial fibrillation, impaired
	automaticity, and conduction delay. In the DCM cohort, additional
	missense (T220I, R814W, D1595H) and truncation (2550-2551insTG) SCN5A
	mutations, segregating with cardiac disease or arising de novo, were
	discovered in unrelated probands. Among individuals with an SCN5A
	mutation 27\% had early features of DCM (mean age at diagnosis, 20.3
	years), 38\% had DCM (mean age at diagnosis, 47.9 years), and 43\%
	had atrial fibrillation (mean age at diagnosis, 27.8 years). CONCLUSIONS:
	Heritable SCN5A defects are associated with susceptibility to early-onset
	DCM and atrial fibrillation. Similar or even identical mutations
	may lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, or both.},

	METHODS: P waves were extracted from 64-lead ECGs recorded in healthy
	subjects. The geometries of torso, lungs, heart, and blood cavities
	of a healthy subject, derived from magnetic resonance imaging, were
	used to position a detailed, thick-walled 3D model of the atria consisting
	of a set of 800,000 units representing the activity of all atrial
	myocytes. The ion-kinetics of the units was based on the formulation
	of Courtemanche et al. The simulated transmembrane potentials following
	a normal sinus beat, as well as those during atrial fibrillation,
	were projected on the 1297 nodes of the surface encapsulating all
	atrial myocytes (endocardium and epicardium). The transmembrane potentials
	at these nodes formed the source strengths of the elements of the
	equivalent generator, which were used to compute body surface potentials.
	RESULTS: After invoking slight adaptations of the timing of depolarization
	of the transmembrane potentials, the simulated signals during the
	P wave closely corresponded to recorded ones. The correspondence
	during the entire PR interval improved markedly after the inclusion
	of early repolarization effects in the interval between the end of
	the P wave and onset of QRS. This demanded a shortening of the mean
	action potential duration generated by the Courtemanche model. The
	simulated ECGs related to atrial fibrillation demonstrated the characteristic
	features of those clinically observed. CONCLUSIONS: The equivalent
	double layer is a useful source model for the genesis of atrial signals
	observed on the thorax. The interval from the end of the P wave to
	onset of QRS is not iso-electric. The Courtemanche model of the ion-kinetics
	of atrial cells needs to be adapted when applied to represent the
	activity of healthy, common' atrial myocytes.},

	and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored.
	METHODS: Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3
	genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant
	protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological
	studies and human atrial action potential modeling. RESULTS: One
	missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a
	high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present
	only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who
	were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C
	KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant
	differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline,
	or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure
	to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels
	showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage
	dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening
	of the modeled atrial action potential duration. CONCLUSIONS: These
	data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to
	cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a "second hit", such
	as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial
	stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics
	(the "first hit"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model
	would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.},

	by fibrillatory conduction emanating from a small number of high-frequency
	reentrant sources (rotors). Our goal was to study the ionic correlates
	of a rotor during simulated chronic AF conditions. We utilized a
	two-dimensional (2-D), homogeneous, isotropic sheet (5 x 5 cm(2))
	of human atrial cells to create a chronic AF substrate, which was
	able to sustain a stable rotor (dominant frequency approximately
	5.7 Hz, rosette-like tip meander approximately 2.6 cm). Doubling
	the magnitude of the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) increased
	rotor frequency ( approximately 8.4 Hz), and reduced tip meander
	(approximately 1.7 cm). This rotor stabilization was due to a shortening
	of the action potential duration and an enhanced cardiac excitability.
	The latter was caused by a hyperpolarization of the diastolic membrane
	potential, which increased the availability of the Na(+) current
	(I(Na)). The rotor was terminated by reducing the maximum conductance
	(by 90\%) of the atrial-specific ultrarapid delayed rectifier K(+)
	current (I(Kur)), or the transient outward K(+) current (I(to)),
	but not the fast or slow delayed rectifier K(+) currents (I(Kr)/I(Ks)).
	Importantly, blockade of I(Kur)/I(to) prolonged the atrial action
	potential at the plateau, but not at the terminal phase of repolarization,
	which led to random tip meander and wavebreak, resulting in rotor
	termination. Altering the rectification profile of I(K1) also slowed
	down or abolished reentrant activity. In combination, these simulation
	results provide novel insights into the ionic bases of a sustained

	and combined into a spatial magnitude ('unfiltered' technique). Results
	were compared with conventionally filtered (40-300 Hz) PSAECG. The
	filtered technique revealed no differences in P-wave duration between
	the two groups (121 +/- 12 vs 128 +/- 15 ms, control and PAF groups
	respectively, ns). Double-peaked P-wave spatial magnitudes (interpeak
	distance >30 ms) were revealed in 11 of 21 PAF patients but only
	in two of 18 controls (P<0.01). The nadir in the spatial magnitude
	was located significantly later in the PAF group (114 +/- 13 vs 103
	+/- 9 ms, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: 'Unfiltered' PSAECG revealed significant
	differences in orthogonal P-wave morphology in patients with lone
	PAF, indicating the possibility of an inter-atrial conduction delay,
	while conventional P-wave duration analysis failed to discriminate
	between the two groups.},

	revived interest into the detailed knowledge of atrial anatomy. The
	atrial septum (AS), known for its complex structure, has been particularly
	difficult to study, and our knowledge of the muscular bundles providing
	routes for intra-atrial and interatrial conduction within the AS
	remains limited. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe
	myocardial arrangement within the AS and adjacent parts of atrial
	walls for delineation of possible substrates for interatrial and
	intra-atrial conduction. METHODS: Human heart specimens from 84 postmortem
	studies were studied using conventional morphometric assessment,
	blunt dissection, and light microscopy of serial histological sections
	of AS. RESULTS: Interatrial muscular connections are present anteriorly,
	posteriorly between right pulmonary veins, and inferiorly between
	the coronary sinus and the right inferior pulmonary vein. The inferior
	connections can be more prominent than the Bachmann bundle. Atrial
	musculature in the fossa ovalis consists of muscular bands isolated
	by fatty tissue from the endocardium of the right and left atrium.
	They are arranged along the anterior-posterior axis and have connections
	with left atrial myocardium. Myocardial fascicles in the posterior-inferior
	and superior portions of the muscular rim of fossa ovalis originate
	on the right atrial side and can be traced toward the atrioventricular
	node. CONCLUSION: The general myocardial arrangement in the AS and
	adjacent regions of atrial walls are important for understanding
	propagation of atrial activation for selection of the optimal treatment
	strategy.},

	The results from all three methods agreed well. We show that a critical
	gradient in action potential duration for conduction block can be
	analytically derived, and once this critical gradient is exceeded,
	the vulnerable window increases proportionately with the refractory
	barrier and is modulated by conduction velocity restitution and gap
	junctional conductance. Moreover, the critical gradient for conduction

	the issue of whether they should be included in clinical ECGI methodology.
	METHODS AND RESULTS: Potential data were obtained for different pacing
	protocols from a dog heart suspended in a human-shaped torso tank.
	Accurate geometry of torso inhomogeneities was digitized from the
	Visual Human Project and appropriately introduced into a computer
	model of the torso. Three models were used: accurate inhomogeneous
	torso, homogeneous torso, and a torso with stylized lungs (to generate
	an approximate model). The inhomogeneous model was used to compute
	BSPMs from the measured epicardial potentials. These BSPMs were the
	starting point for inverse computations in the different torso models.
	Epicardial potential maps, EGMs, and isochrones were computed. The
	homogeneous model produced slightly less accurate epicardial potential
	reconstructions than the inhomogeneous model and stylized lung model,
	but epicardial potential patterns, EGMs, isochrones, and locations
	of pacing sites were reconstructed with comparable accuracy when

	the effects of torso inhomogeneities, which include blood, lungs,
	bone, muscle, fat, and fluid. It is necessary to characterize and
	understand these effects in order to interpret BSPM and ECG in terms
	of cardiac activity without "contamination" from the inhomogeneous
	volume conductor. METHODS AND RESULTS: Actual measured epicardial
	and body surface potentials were obtained during normal sinus rhythm
	and for different pacing protocols from a Langendorff-perfused dog
	heart suspended in a human-shaped torso tank. Accurate geometry of
	the torso inhomogeneities was digitized from the Visual Human Project
	and appropriately introduced into a computer model of the tank setup.
	The geometry and electrical properties of the volume conductor could
	be varied. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous torsos have major smoothing
	effects on BSPM, which is of very low resolution compared with its
	corresponding epicardial potential pattern. Relative to a homogeneous
	torso, the inhomogeneities have only a minor effect on BSPM patterns.
	They augment potential magnitudes depending on the pattern of epicardial
	activation. Variations of geometry and electrical properties within
	the normal physiologic range have minimal effects. CONCLUSION: Effects
	of torso inhomogeneities on 12-lead ECGs are minimal, and the associated
	ECG changes fall within the range of normal interindividual variations.},

	a mathematical method for using ion current data to predict the effect

  abstract = {Abnormal excitability of myocardial cells may give rise to ectopic
	beats and initiate re-entry around an anatomical or functional obstacle.
	As K(+) currents control the repolarization process of the cardiac
	action potential (AP), the K(+) channel function determines membrane
	potential and refractoriness of the myocardium. Both gain and loss
	of the K(+) channel function can lead to arrhythmia. The former because
	abbreviation of the active potential duration (APD) shortens refractoriness
	and wave length, and thereby facilitates re-entry and the latter
	because excessive prolongation of APD may lead to torsades de pointes
	(TdP) arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The pro-arrhythmic consequences
	of malfunctioning K(+) channels in ventricular and atrial tissue
	are discussed in the light of three pathophysiologically relevant
	aspects: genetic background, drug action, and disease-induced remodelling.
	In the ventricles, loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding
	for K(+) channels and many drugs (mainly hERG channel blockers) are
	related to hereditary and acquired long-QT syndrome, respectively,
	that put individuals at high risk for developing TdP arrhythmias
	and life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. Similarly, down-regulation
	of K(+) channels in heart failure also increases the risk for sudden
	cardiac death. Mutations and polymorphisms in genes encoding for
	atrial K(+) channels can be associated with gain-of-function and
	shortened, or with loss-of-function and prolonged APs. The block
	of atrial K(+) channels becomes a particular therapeutic challenge
	when trying to ameliorate atrial fibrillation (AF). This arrhythmia
	has a strong tendency to cause electrical remodelling, which affects
	many K(+) channels. Atrial-selective drugs for the treatment of AF
	without affecting the ventricles could target structures such as
	I(Kur) or constitutively active I(K,ACh) channels.},

	(S140G and V141M) have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF).
	Previous heterologous expression studies found that both mutations
	caused I(Ks) to be instantaneously activated, presumably by preventing
	channel closure. The purpose of this study was to refine our understanding
	of the channel gating defects caused by these two mutations located
	in the S1 domain of KCNQ1. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to
	replace S140 or V141 with several other natural amino acids. Wild-type
	and mutant channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes
	and channel function was assessed with the two-microelectrode voltage
	clamp technique. Long intervals between voltage clamp pulses revealed
	that S140G and V141M KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels are not constitutively
	active as previously reported, but instead exhibit extremely slow
	deactivation. The slow component of I(Ks) deactivation was decreased
	62-fold by S140G and 140-fold by the V141M mutation. In addition,
	the half-point for activation of these mutant I(Ks) channels was
	approximately 50 mV more negative than wild-type channels. Other
	substitutions of S140 or V141 in KCNQ1 caused variable shifts in
	the voltage dependence of activation, but slowed I(Ks) deactivation
	to a much lesser extent than the AF-associated mutations. Based on
	a published structural model of KCNQ1, S140 and V141 are located
	near E160 in S2 and R237 in S4, two charged residues that could form
	a salt bridge when the channel is in the open state. In support of
	this model, mutational exchange of E160 and R237 residues produced
	a constitutively open channel. Together our findings suggest that
	altered charge-pair interactions within the voltage sensor module
	of KCNQ1 subunits may account for slowed I(Ks) deactivation induced

	atrial anatomy. Atrial fibrillation was initiated in 65.7\% of the
	simulations. Stable excitation patterns were broken up in anatomically

	similar to snakes. Multiple wavelets and rotors could be observed
	in anatomically smooth areas at the atria's roofs. CONCLUSIONS: The

  abstract = {Life-threatening arrhythmias have been suspected as one cause of the
	sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and this hypothesis is supported
	by the observation that mutations in arrhythmia susceptibility genes
	occur in 5-10\% of cases. However, the functional consequences of
	cardiac potassium channel gene mutations associated with SIDS and
	how these alleles might mechanistically predispose to sudden death
	are unknown. To address these questions, we studied four missense
	KCNH2 (encoding HERG) variants, one compound KCNH2 genotype, and
	a missense KCNQ1 mutation all previously identified in Norwegian
	SIDS cases. Three of the six variants exhibited functional impairments
	while three were biophysically similar to wild-type channels (KCNH2
	variants V279M, R885C, and S1040G). When co-expressed with WT-HERG,
	R273Q and K897T/R954C generated currents resembling the rapid component
	of the cardiac delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) but with significantly
	diminished amplitude. Action potential modeling demonstrated that
	this level of functional impairment was sufficient to evoke increased
	action potential duration and pause-dependent early afterdepolarizations.
	By contrast, KCNQ1-I274V causes a gain-of-function in I(Ks) characterized
	by increased current density, faster activation, and slower deactivation
	leading to accumulation of instantaneous current upon repeated stimulation.
	Action potential simulations using a Markov model of heterozygous
	I274V-I(Ks) incorporated into the Luo-Rudy (LRd) ventricular cell
	model demonstrated marked rate-dependent shortening of action potential
	duration predicting a short QT phenotype. Our results indicate that
	certain potassium channel mutations associated with SIDS confer overt
	functional defects consistent with either LQTS or SQTS, and further
	emphasize the role of congenital arrhythmia susceptibility in this

	to generate current during the AP repolarization phase. By doing

	and functional studies have demonstrated that I Kr channels are heteromers
	composed of both hERG 1a and 1b subunits, yet our current understanding
	of I Kr functional properties derives primarily from studies of homooligomers
	of the original hERG 1a isolate. Here, we examine currents produced
	by hERG 1a and 1a/1b channels expressed in HEK-293 cells at near-physiological
	temperatures. We find that heteromeric hERG 1a/1b currents are much
	larger than hERG 1a currents and conduct 80\% more charge during
	an action potential. This surprising difference corresponds to a
	2-fold increase in the apparent rates of activation and recovery
	from inactivation, thus reducing rectification and facilitating current
	rebound during repolarization. Kinetic modeling shows these gating
	differences account quantitatively for the differences in current
	amplitude between the 2 channel types. Drug sensitivity was also
	different. Compared to homomeric 1a channels, heteromeric 1a/1b channels
	were inhibited by E-4031 with a slower time course and a corresponding
	4-fold shift in the IC50. The importance of hERG 1b in vivo is supported
	by the identification of a 1b-specific A8V missense mutation in 1/269
	unrelated genotype-negative LQTS patients that was absent in 400
	control alleles. Mutant 1bA8V expressed alone or with hERG 1a in
	HEK-293 cells dramatically reduced 1b protein levels. Thus, mutations
	specifically disrupting hERG 1b function are expected to reduce cardiac
	I Kr and enhance drug sensitivity, and represent a potential mechanism
	underlying inherited or acquired LQTS.},

	A perfused heart was suspended in a cylinder and surrounded with

	included conductivity and boundary effects and assumed a uniform
	double-layer source. Three instants (early, late, and mid QRS) during

	studied. There was good qualitative agreement between recorded and

	beat, but there were quantitative differences. The cardiac generator
	was far stronger late in the QRS. In mid QRS, the agreement between

	muscles (PM), appendages (APG) and Bachmann's bundle (BB) were segmented
	in this work. Fibre orientation in CT, PM and BB was set to local
	longitudinal direction.Descriptions for all used cell types were
	based on modifications of the Courtemanche et al. model of a human
	atrial cell. Maximum conductances of Ito, IKr and ICa,L were modified
	for PM, CT, APG and atrioventricular ring to reproduce measured action
	potentials (AP). Pacemaker activity in the human SAN was reproduced
	by removing IK1, but including If, ICa,T, and gradients of channel
	conductances as described in previous studies for heterogeneous rabbit
	SAN.Anisotropic conduction was computed with a monodomain model using
	the finite element method. The transversal to longitudinal ratio
	of conductivity for PM, CT and BB was 1:9. Atrial working myocardium
	(AWM) was set to be isotropic.Simulation of atrial electrophysiology
	showed initiation of APs in the SAN centre. The excitation spread
	afterwards to the periphery near to the region of the CT and preferentially
	towards the atrioventricular region. The excitation extends over
	the right atrium along PM. Both CT and PM activated the right AWM.
	Earliest activation of the left atrium was through BB and excitation
	spread over to the APG. The conduction velocities were 0.6ms-1 for
	AWM, 1.2ms-1 for CT, 1.6ms-1 for PM and 1.1ms-1 for BB at a rate
	of 63bpm.The simulations revealed that bundles form dominant pathways
	for atrial conduction. The preferential conduction towards CT and
	along PM is comparable with clinical mapping. Repolarization is more
	homogeneous than excitation due to the heterogeneous distribution
	of electrophysiological properties and hence the action potential
	duration.},

	characteristic morphology of the potentials. Vagal stimulation resulted
	in a short-lasting initial slowing of spontaneous rate followed by
	a long-lasting secondary slowing; a brief period of relative or absolute
	acceleration was interposed between the two slowing phases. During
	these changes of spontaneous rate, the leading pacemaker site shifted
	in a complex beat-to-beat manner by 1-6 mm alongside the crista terminalis
	in the superior or inferior direction. For the first spontaneous
	excitation following stimulation, the greater the slowing, the larger
	the distance of the pacemaker shift. There was no such linear relationship
	between the extent of slowing and the distance of pacemaker shift
	for the subsequent beats. These changes in the leading pacemaker

	in particular, the channel develops an available reserve of closed

	Because of its ability to form an available reserve, IKs can function
	as a repolarization reserve when IKr, the rapid delayed rectifier,
	is reduced by disease or drug and can prevent excessive action potential
	prolongation and development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.},

	The present report describes the preliminary clinical use of body

	accomplished by matching the P wave integral map of a single AT beat
	with the data base of paced P wave integral maps. The use of body

	shape throughout the heart is necessary to explain normal and pathological

	equations is a tedious process. The study describes the integration
	of a pre-existing mathematical model of an atrial cell AP with a

	arbitrary cells by fitting ionic channel conductances. Using the
	Nygren model as the base, the technique was first verified by starting

	error of only 0.03\%. The Courtemanche model, which has a different

	The AP duration restitution curve generated by the fit matched that
	of the target model very well. Finally, experimentally recorded APs
	were reproduced. To match AP duration restitution behaviour properly,
	it was necessary simultaneously to fit over several stimulation frequencies.
	Also, fitting of the upstroke was better if the stimulating current
	pulse replicated that found in situ as opposed to a rectangular pulse.
	In conclusion, the modelled parameters were successfully able to

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanisms underlying the initiation of ventricular arrhythmias
	in ischemia by a premature beat or after a pause remain unclear.
	The kinetics of electrical restitution, which is the modulation of
	action potential duration (APD) by an abrupt alteration in cycle
	length, may be important. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recorded one or
	two simultaneous monophasic action potentials (MAPs) from the right
	ventricular septum during balloon occlusion of the left anterior
	descending coronary artery (LAD) (14 patients), which is expected
	to induce ischemia at the recording site, and during occlusion of
	the right coronary artery (RCA) (7 patients), which is not expected
	to induce ischemia at the recording area. The latter acted as a control.
	A test pulse sequence was incorporated whereby during steady-state
	pacing, test beats of altered cycle length were interpose. During
	LAD occlusion, APD for basic beats shortened from 260 +/- 4 to 236
	+/- 4 ms (P < .0001), whereas the control group (RCA occlusion) showed
	no significant change (251 +/- 7 to 249 +/- 9 ms; P = NS). LAD occlusion
	resulted in flattening of the slope relating APD of test beats to
	diastolic interval (P = .001), whereas in the control group (RCA
	occlusion) the slope remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained
	during a second occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: LAD occlusion in patients
	during balloon angioplasty shortened MAP duration of basic beats
	and minimized, abolished, or reversed the normal APD/diastolic-interval
	relation of test beats of altered cycle length at sites served by
	the occluded vessel. The results suggest that ischemia flattens the
	electrical restitution curve in the human endocardium. These findings
	may have important implications in arrhythmogenesis.},

  abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the main causes of death in
	the Western world. According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation
	dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action
	potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the
	slope of the APD restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such
	as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether
	these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions
	for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. Therefore,
	we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell model, which
	is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution
	and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium
	dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical
	instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells,
	and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue.
	We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability
	is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium
	current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation
	and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress
	restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution
	slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for
	electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the
	onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within
	the range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude
	that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism
	for VF in the human heart.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since altered expression of gap junction proteins (connexins)
	in diseased myocardial tissue may lead to abnormal electrical coupling
	between cardiomyocytes and hence contribute to arrhythmogenesis,
	the expression of connexin(Cx)40 and Cx43 was studied in atrial appendage
	from goats in sinus rhythm (SR) and persistent atrial fibrillation
	(AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Biopsies were taken from the left and
	right atrial appendages from goats in SR or after pacing-induced
	persistent AF. Analyses of Cx40 and Cx43 mRNA and protein levels,
	using quantitative (competitive) polymerase chain reaction and western
	blotting, respectively, revealed no significant changes in the overall
	expression of Cx40 and Cx43 as a result of persistent AF. At the
	cellular level, immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning
	microscopy showed a homogeneous distribution of either connexin in
	atrial sections taken during SR. After induction of AF, the distribution
	of Cx43 gap junctions was unchanged whereas the Cx40 pattern showed
	marked inhomogeneities with small areas (0.15 to 0.6 mm in diameter,
	25\% of section surface area) of low-density Cx40 located between
	larger areas of normal (unchanged) Cx40 density. Activation mapping
	(244 electrodes, spatial resolution 2.25 mm) of the right atrial
	wall did not reveal changes in atrial conduction velocity. CONCLUSION:
	Pacing-induced persistent AF in the goat gave rise to changes in
	the spatial organization of Cx40 gap junctions. Although the overall
	conduction velocity appeared not to have changed, microheterogeneities
	in conduction due to the local redistribution of Cx40 gap junctions
	might have contributed to the initiation and maintenance of AF.},

  abstract = {A comparison between traditional numerical integration methods and
	a new hybrid integration method for the reconstruction of action
	potential activity is presented, using a mathematical model of the
	cardiac Purkinje fiber (MNT model). It is shown that the hybrid integration
	method reduces importantly the overall computation time required
	for solving the Hodgkin-Huxley differential equations describing
	membrane electrical events. To accomplish this, the particular form
	of the gating variable equations is exploited to reformulate the
	step-by-step computation. In this way, the time increment can be
	made much larger compared with traditional methods when the membrane
	potential changes slowly. A mathematical analysis of the hybrid integration
	method is presented also, together with a numerical verification
	of its performance both for the propagated and nonpropagated membrane
	action potential. It is shown that the local error, that is the error
	arising at each integration step, and the cumulative integration
	error are strictly controlled by the membrane potential offset. Using
	the MNT model, the nonpropagated cardiac Purkinje action potential
	can be reconstructed in real time with an accuracy of 1\% for the
	potential and 5\% for the time of occurrence of its main features.
	In reconstructing propagated events, the hybrid integration method
	allows computation time savings by a factor of 10 or more compared
	to accurate Runge-Kutta schemes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.
	In ablation procedures, identification of the reentrant pathways
	is vital. This has proven difficult because of the complex morphology
	of the atria. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the role
	of specific anatomic structures on reentry induction and maintenance.
	METHOD AND RESULTS: A computationally efficient, morphologically
	realistic, computer model of the atria was developed that incorporates
	its major structural features, including discrete electrical connections
	between the right and left atria, physiologic fiber orientation in
	three dimensions, muscle structures representing the crista terminalis
	(CT) and pectinate muscles, and openings for the veins and AV valves.
	Reentries were induced near the venous openings in the left and right
	atria, the mouth of the coronary sinus, and the free wall of the
	right atrium. The roles of certain muscular structures were ascertained
	by selectively removing the structures and observing how the propagation
	of activity was affected. CONCLUSION: (1) The muscular sheath of
	the coronary sinus acts as a pathway for a reentrant circuit and
	stabilizes any circuits that utilize the isthmus near the inferior
	vena cava. (2) Poor trans-CT coupling serves to stabilize flutter
	circuits. (3) Wall thickness is an important factor in the propagation
	of electrical activity, especially in the left atrium. (4) The openings
	of the inferior and superior venae cavae form natural anatomic anchors
	that make reentry easier to initiate by allowing for smaller ectopic
	beats to induce reentry.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional
	electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation
	(AF), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.
	METHODS: The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record
	action potentials, the effective refractory period (ERP) and ion
	currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically
	isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6 months) AF and
	39 patients in sinus rhythm. RESULTS: Stimulation at high rates (up
	to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the
	ERP in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum
	diastolic potential (MDP). Chronic AF was associated with a reduction
	in the ERP at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, P<0.05),
	and marked attenuation in rate effects on the ERP and repolarisation.
	The abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced
	depolarisation of the MDP in cells from patients with AF. The density
	of L-type Ca(2+) (I(CaL)) and transient outward K(+) (I(TO)) currents
	was significantly reduced in cells from patients with AF (by 60-65\%),
	whilst the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was increased, and
	the sustained outward current (I(KSUS)) was unaltered. Superfusion
	of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l)
	moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the ERP
	(228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-Aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged
	repolarisation and the ERP (by 35\%, P<0.05). However, the combination
	of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.
	CONCLUSION: Chronic AF in humans is associated with attenuation in
	adaptation of the atrial single cell ERP and MDP to fast rates, which
	may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in I(CaL) and
	I(TO).},

	across the coronary sinus ostium (cross-CSo) and within the coronary
	sinus (intra-CS) in patients with and without paroxysmal atrial (AF)
	fibrillation and to estimate the interatrial conduction deterioration
	area in AF patients. BACKGROUND: Interatrial conduction delay in
	AF patients has been reported. However, localization of the interatrial
	conduction delay still is not clear. METHODS: Thirteen patients with
	paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia
	or ectopic atrial tachycardia were enrolled in the study. Right atrial
	and CS mapping were performed using the CARTO electroanatomic mapping
	system during sinus rhythm and during distal CS pacing. The activation
	times and spatial distances of cross-CSo and intra-CS were measured
	between paired sites, from which the activation velocities of cross-CSo
	and intra-CS were obtained. RESULTS: During sinus rhythm, the activation
	velocities of cross-CSo in the AF group (1.2 +/- 0.2 m/s) were significantly
	slower than those in the control group (2.9 +/- 1.6 m/s, P < .05).
	During distal CS pacing, the cross-CSo velocities of the AF group
	(1.0 +/- 0.5 m/s) also appeared slower than those in the control
	group (1.4 +/- 0.2 m/s, P = .07). However, no difference was found
	in intra-CS activation velocities between the two groups (2.8 +/-
	1.9 vs 3.2 +/- 2.2 m/s and 1.5 +/- 0.3 vs 1.4 +/- 0.3 m/s, P > .05
	during sinus rhythm and distal CS pacing, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
	Interatrial conduction at the posteroparaseptal region across the
	CS ostium was significantly slower in patients with paroxysmal AF
	than in control patients, further supporting the link between interatrial
	conduction deterioration and paroxysmal AF.},

	involved in normal pacemaking as well as arrhythmias and the objective
	was to determine the distribution of HCN4 (major isoform underlying
	the pacemaker current, I(f)) in the atria. METHODS: In the atria
	of the rat, the localisation of HCN4 and connexins was determined
	using immunohistochemistry, and electrical activity was recorded
	using extracellular electrodes. RESULTS: As expected, HCN4 and Cx45
	(but not Cx43) were expressed in the sinoatrial node extending from
	the superior vena cava down the crista terminalis. The same pattern
	of expression of HCN4 and connexins was observed in a novel tract
	of nodal-like cells extending from the superior vena cava down the
	interatrial groove. Although the sinoatrial node was usually the
	leading pacemaker site, the novel tract of HCN4-expressing cells
	was capable of pacemaking and could act as the leading pacemaker
	site; there was evidence of a hierarchy of pacemakers. The same pattern
	of expression of HCN4 and connexins was also observed in the atrioventricular
	ring bundle (including the atrioventricular node) encircling the
	tricuspid valve, but not in the atrioventricular ring bundle encircling
	the mitral valve. HCN4 was not expressed in the pulmonary veins.
	CONCLUSIONS: The widespread distribution of HCN4 can explain the
	widespread location of the leading pacemaker site during sinus rhythm,
	the extensive region of tissue that has to be ablated to stop sinus
	rhythm, and the widespread distribution of ectopic foci responsible
	for atrial tachycardia.},

	(ECG) P-wave morphology to recognize the paced pulmonary vein (PV).
	BACKGROUND: Prediction of arrhythmogenic PVs producing ectopy or
	initiating atrial fibrillation (AF) using 12-lead ECG may facilitate
	curative ablation. METHODS: In 30 patients P-wave configurations
	were studied during sinus rhythm and during pacing at six sites from
	the four PVs: top and bottom of each superior PV and both inferior
	PVs. The P-wave amplitude, duration and morphology were assessed,
	and predictive accuracies were calculated for the most significant
	parameters. An algorithm predicting the paced PV was developed and
	prospectively evaluated in a different population of 20 patients.
	RESULTS; Three criteria were used to distinguish right from left
	PV: 1) a positive P-wave in lead aVL and the amplitude of P-wave
	in lead I > or =50 microV indicated right PV origin (specificity
	100\% and 97\%, respectively); 2) a notched P-wave in lead II was
	a predictor of left PV origin (specificity 95\%); and 3) the amplitude
	ratio of lead III/II and the duration of positivity in lead V(1)
	were also helpful in distinguishing left versus right PV origin.
	In addition, superior PVs could be distinguished from inferior according
	to the amplitude in lead II (> or =100 microV). In prospective evaluation,
	an algorithm based on the above four criteria identified 93\% of
	left versus right PV and totally 79\% of the specific PVs paced.
	CONCLUSIONS: Pacing from the different PVs produced a P-wave with
	distinctive characteristics that could be used as criteria in an
	algorithm to identify the PV of origin with an accuracy of 79\%.},

  abstract = {Two characteristic features of the rapid component of the cardiac
	delayed rectifier current (IKr) are prominent inward rectification
	and an unexpected reduction in activating current with decreased
	[K+]o. Similar features are observed with heterologous expression
	of HERG, the gene thought to encode the channel carrying IKr, moreover,
	recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying rectification
	of HERG current is the inactivation that channels rapidly undergo
	during depolarizing pulses. The present studies were designed to
	determine the mechanism of IKr rectification and [K+]o sensitivity
	in the mouse atrial myocyte cell line, AT-1 cells. Reducing [Mg2+]i
	to 0, which reverses inward rectification of some K+ channels, did
	not alter IKr current-voltage relationships, although it did decrease
	sensitivity to the IKr blockers dofetilide and quinidine 2- to 5-fold.
	To determine the presence and extent of fast inactivation of IKr
	in AT-1 cells, a brief hyperpolarizing pulse (20 ms to -120 mV) was
	applied during long depolarizations. Immediately after this pulse,
	a very large outward current that decayed rapidly to the previous
	activating current baseline was observed. This outward current component
	was blocked by the IKr-specific inhibitor dofetilide, indicating
	that it represented recovery from fast inactivation during the hyperpolarizing
	step, with fast reinactivation during the return to depolarized potential.
	With removal of inactivation using this approach, current-voltage
	relationships for IKr ([K+]o, 1 to 20 mmol/L) were linar and reversed
	close to the predicted Nernst potential for K+. In addition, decreased
	[K+]o decreased the time constants for open-->inactivated and inactivated-->open
	transitions. Thus, in these cardiac myocytes, as with heterologously
	expressed HERG, IKr undergoes fast inactivation that determines its
	characteristic inward rectification. These studies demonstrate that
	the mechanism underlying decreased activating current observed at
	low [K+]o is more extensive fast inactivation.},

	discrete areas (domains) with a uniform DF within each domain. The
	DFs in adjacent domains were often in 1:2, 3:4, or 4:5 ratios, which
	was shown to be a result of an intermittent Wenckebach-like conduction
	block at the domain boundaries. The domain patterns were relatively
	stable and could persist from several seconds to several minutes.
	The complexity in the organization of the domains, the number of
	domains, and the dispersion of frequencies increased with the rate
	of the arrhythmia. Domain patterns on the epicardial and endocardial

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although previous studies in dogs have indicated a minimal
	role for changes in I(K1) in the shortening of action potential duration
	(APD) associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), in humans, there
	is evidence for significant AF-induced up-regulation of this current.
	In this computer model study, we investigated the relative contributions
	of the remodeling of I(K1), L-type calcium current, and other remodeled
	ionic channel currents to AF-induced APD reduction in human atrium.
	METHODS: Two computer models of electrical activity of human atrial
	cell were modified by incorporating experimental data of AF-induced
	changes in human atrial ionic channel conductance and kinetics reported
	by Bosch et al. (I(CaL), I(to), I(K1), and I(Na)) (AF-1) and Workman
	et al. (I(CaL), I(to), and I(K1)) (AF-2). The roles and relative
	importance of individually remodeled ion channels in the APD reduction
	in human atrium were evaluated by the removal and exclusive methods,
	in which remodeling of specific currents was omitted, or considered
	in isolation, in the two models. RESULTS: When tested together, previously
	reported AF-induced changes in sarcolemmal ion currents result in
	marked shortening of atrial APD(90). With the AF-1 remodeled parameters,
	there is a 62\% reduction in APD(90) for the Nygren et al. model,
	and a 68\% reduction for the Courtemanche et al. model, which are
	comparable to experimental results of 60\% reduction seen in humans.
	When tested individually, AF-1-induced changes in I(CaL), I(K1),
	or I(to) alone result in APD(90) reduction of 20\%, 64\%, and -10\%,
	respectively, for the Nygren et al. model, and 27\%, 40\%, and 11.6\%,
	respectively, for the Courtemanche et al. model. With the AF-2 remodeled
	parameters, there is a 47\% reduction in APD(90) for the Nygren et
	al. model and a 49\% reduction for the Courtemanche et al. model,
	which are also comparable to experimental results of 45\% reduction.
	When tested individually, AF-2-induced changes in I(CaL) or I(K1)
	alone result in APD(90) reduction of 20\% and 40\%, respectively,
	for the Nygren et al. model, and 14\% and 21\%, respectively, for
	the Courtemanche et al. model. CONCLUSION: Previously reported changes
	in L-type Ca(2+) current are insufficient to account for the observed
	reduction in atrial APD associated with persistent AF. Up-regulation
	of I(K1) has a greater influence on atrial APD in the human model.},

	in repolarisation of cardiac ventricular action potentials (APs).
	In recent years, a novel clinical condition denoted the short QT
	syndrome (SQTS) has been identified and, very recently, gain in function
	mutations in the gene encoding the pore-forming sub-unit of the I(Kr)
	channel have been proposed to underlie SQTS in some patients. Here,
	computer simulations were used to investigate the effects of the
	selective loss of voltage-dependent inactivation of I(Kr) upon ventricular
	APs and on the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. I(Kr) and inactivation-deficient
	I(Kr) were incorporated into Luo-Rudy ventricular AP models. Inactivation-deficient
	I(Kr) produced AP shortening that was heterogeneous between endocardial,
	mid-myocardial, and epicardial ventricular cell models, irrespective
	of whether heterogeneity between these sub-regions was incorporated
	of slow delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) alone, or of I(Ks)
	together with that of transient outward K(+) current. The selective
	loss of rectification of I(Kr) did not augment transmural dispersion
	of AP repolarisation, as AP shortening was greater in mid-myocardial
	than in endo- or epicardial cell models. Simulated conduction through
	a 1 D transmural ventricular strand was altered by incorporation
	of inactivation-deficient I(Kr) and the reconstructed QT interval
	was shortened. Collectively, these results substantiate the notion
	that selective loss of I(Kr) inactivation produces a gain in I(Kr)

  abstract = {Frank P loop vectorcardiograms were recorded in 30 normal subjects
	and in 40 patients who had intraatrial conduction disturbances alone
	or in association with cardiac disease. High magnification of the
	P loop (0.1 mv = 3 cm) permitted accurate measurement of the P loop
	duration, magnitude and direction. High-frequency recordings allowed
	optimal evaluation of the notches, bites and conduction delays in
	the PsE loop. Four vectorcardiographic patterns have been selected
	as counterparts of the four types of enlarged P waves seen in electrocardiograms
	of patients with atrial conduction disturbances. When intraatrial
	conduction disturbances coexisted with left atrial enlargment, the
	PsE loop was larger and smoother. The role of partial or complete
	block in the specific internodal or interatrial pathways is discussed.
	High magnification, high-frequency vectorcardiography of the P loop
	seems to be the best available method for determing a specific pattern
	of intraatrial conduction disturbance.},

  abstract = {Tissue size has been considered an important determinant of atrial
	fibrillation (AF), but recent work has questioned the critical size
	hypothesis. Here, we use a previously developed mathematical model
	of the two-dimensional canine atrium with realistic action potential,
	ionic, and conduction properties to address substrate size effects
	on the maintenance of fibrillatory activity. Cholinergic AF was simulated
	at different acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations ([ACh]) and distributions,
	with substrate area varied 11.1-fold. Automated phase singularity
	detection was used to facilitate the analysis of arrhythmic activity.
	The duration of activity induced by a single extrastimulus increased
	with increasing substrate dimensions. Two general mechanisms underlying
	activity were observed and were differentially affected by substrate
	size. For large mean [ACh], single primary rotors anchored in low-[ACh]
	zones maintained activity and substrate dimensions were not critical.
	At lower mean [ACh], extensive spiral wave meander prevented the
	emergence of single stable rotors. Prolonged activity was favored
	when substrate size permitted a sufficiently large number of simultaneous
	longer-lasting rotors that extinction of all was unlikely. Thus either
	single dominant rotor or multiple reentrant spiral generator mechanisms
	could maintain fibrillatory activity in this model and were differentially
	dependent on substrate size. These results speak to recent debates
	about the role in AF of single driver rotors versus multiple reentrant
	circuit mechanisms by suggesting that either may maintain fibrillatory
	atrial activity depending on atrial size and electrophysiological
	properties.},
