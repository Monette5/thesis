  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a decrease
	in atrial ERP and ERP adaptation to rate as well as changes in atrial
	conduction velocity. The cellular changes in repolarization and the
	underlying ionic mechanisms in human AF are only poorly understood.
	METHODS: Action potentials (AP) and ionic currents were studied with
	the patch clamp technique in single atrial myocytes from patients
	in chronic AF and compared to those from patients in stable sinus
	rhythm (SR). RESULTS: The presence of AF was associated with a marked
	shortening of the AP duration and a decreased rate response of atrial
	repolarization. L-type calcium current (ICa,L) and the transient
	outward current (Ito) were both reduced about 70\% in AF, whereas
	an increased steady-state outward current was detectable at test
	potentials between -30 and 0 mV. The inward rectifier potassium current
	(IKI) and the acetylcholine-activated potassium current (IKACh) were
	increased in AF at hyperpolarizing potentials. Voltage-dependent
	inactivation of the fast sodium current (INa) was shifted to more
	positive voltages in AF. CONCLUSIONS: AF in humans leads to important
	changes in atrial potassium and calcium currents that likely contribute
	to the decrease in APD and APD rate adaptation. These changes contribute
	to electrical remodeling in AF and are therefore important factors
	for the perpetuation of the arrhythmia.},

	are in general limited to mapping electrical activity on the heart
	surface. Computational models of action potential propagation offer
	a potentially powerful way to study electrical activation and arrhythmias,

	In this paper, we describe a framework for computing action potential
	propagation in which the geometry, electrophysiology and regional
	properties of ventricular myocardium can be specified so that, for
	example, different models for cardiac cellular electrophysiology
	can be used. We have computed action potential propagation during
	both normal beats and re-entry in an anatomically accurate model
	of ventricular geometry. By computing the resultant electric current
	flow in the torso we have also generated simulated ECG signals that
	result from specific activation patterns in the ventricular model.
	Models can be powerful tools for explaining observations, and this
	approach is able to provide a direct link between the different configurations

	resonance imaging. These geometries were used to construct a numerical
	volume conductor model. The boundary element method was applied to
	simulate the potentials on the surface of the thorax generated by
	the atria. The equivalent double layer served as the source description
	during depolarization. Recorded body surface potentials were used
	as a check on the simulations. Subsequently, the conductivities in

	and amplitude. RESULTS: The model with realistic conductivity values
	for blood and lungs produced potentials that closely matched the
	measured ones (correlation 98%). The subsequent variation of conductivity
	of blood and lungs revealed a major influence on P wave morphology

  volume = {8},
  pages = {20-47},

  abstract = {Wave propagation in ventricular muscle is rendered highly anisotropic
	by the intramural rotation of the fiber. This rotational anisotropy
	is especially important because it can produce a twist of electrical
	vortices, which measures the rate of rotation (in degree/mm) of activation
	wavefronts in successive planes perpendicular to a line of phase
	singularity, or filament. This twist can then significantly alter
	the dynamics of the filament. This paper explores this dynamics via
	numerical simulation. After a review of the literature, we present
	modeling tools that include: (i) a simplified ionic model with three
	membrane currents that approximates well the restitution properties
	and spiral wave behavior of more complex ionic models of cardiac
	action potential (Beeler-Reuter and others), and (ii) a semi-implicit
	algorithm for the fast solution of monodomain cable equations with
	rotational anisotropy. We then discuss selected results of a simulation
	study of vortex dynamics in a parallelepipedal slab of ventricular
	muscle of varying wall thickness (S) and fiber rotation rate (theta(z)).
	The main finding is that rotational anisotropy generates a sufficiently
	large twist to destabilize a single transmural filament and cause
	a transition to a wave turbulent state characterized by a high density
	of chaotically moving filaments. This instability is manifested by
	the propagation of localized disturbances along the filament and
	has no previously known analog in isotropic excitable media. These
	disturbances correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of
	filament, or "twistons," that create vortex rings when colliding
	with the natural boundaries of the ventricle. Moreover, when sufficiently
	twisted, these rings expand and create additional filaments by further
	colliding with boundaries. This instability mechanism is distinct
	from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave breakup that is
	not observed here during the initial instability. For modified Beeler-Reuter-like
	kinetics with stable reentry in two dimensions, decay into turbulence
	occurs in the left ventricle in about one second above a critical
	wall thickness in the range of 4-6 mm that matches experiment. However
	this decay is suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability. Specific
	experiments to test these results, and a method to characterize the
	filament density during fibrillation are discussed. Results are contrasted
	with other mechanisms of fibrillation and future prospects are summarized.

	blood masses augment radially oriented dipoles and diminish tangentially
	oriented ones. With regard to the vectorcardiogram , the electrocardiogram,

	(temporal filtering) and of isopotential contours in the body surface
	potential maps (spatial filtering) with a consequent loss of information,

  abstract = {AIMS: Although the perpetuation of several supraventricular arrhythmias
	is critically dependent upon intra-atrial conduction, the literature
	lacks detailed information on normal values of conduction velocity
	and degree of anisotropy. In order to explore these factors further,
	we have measured conduction velocities at the right atrial free wall
	during sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing in four directions parallel
	and perpendicular to the atrioventricular groove in patients with
	normal atria and stable sinus rhythm. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using
	a Bard Cardiac Mapping System, atrial ECGs were recorded using a
	3 x 4 cm electrode array with 56 equally spaced bipolar electrodes
	in 12 patients undergoing open heart surgery due to ischaemic heart
	disease or Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. A bipolar pen probe connected
	to a Medtronic 5328 stimulator was used for pacing at a 10\% higher
	rate than sinus rhythm. The local activation times were manually
	set and isochronal activation maps were created for each recording.
	The conduction velocities were calculated from the activation maps
	over a distance ranging from 2.2 to 4.2 cm. The majority of the activation
	maps showed no signs of anisotropy; the others had less than 15\%
	spatial inhomogeneity of conduction. Mean conduction velocity, calculated
	from five consecutive beats, was 88 +/- 9 cm.s-1 (mean +/- SD), ranging
	between 68 +/- 4 and 103 +/- 3 cm.s-1 during sinus rhythm. Mean conduction
	velocity during atrial pacing was 81 +/- 16 cm.s-1 at a propagation
	direction of 0 degree, 74 +/- 14 cm.s-1 at a 90 degrees direction,
	79 +/- 12 cm.s-1 at 180 degrees and 78 +/- 20 cm.s-1 at 270 degrees,
	where 0 degree was parallel to the atrioventricular groove in the
	cranial direction and the angle increased counter-clockwise. Mean
	conduction velocity during sinus rhythm was significantly higher
	(P < 0.05) than during atrial pacing at the 90 degrees and 180 degrees
	directions but not compared to atrial pacing at 0 degree or 270 degrees.
	There was no significant difference in mean conduction velocity in
	different directions during atrial pacing. CONCLUSION: Although anisotropy
	was documented during conduction velocity in individual cases, conduction
	velocity was not dependent on propagation direction at the epicardial
	right atrial free wall in patients with stable sinus rhythm. These
	findings do not exclude the presence of internodal preferential pathways
	as these are located sub-epicardially and a marked transmural discordance
	in activation has previously been documented in the vicinity of such
	pathways.},

	process of wavefront propagation and arrhythmogenesis in human atria,
	technical concerns and issues of patient safety have limited experimental
	investigations. The present work describes a finite volume-based
	computer model of human atrial activation and current flow to complement
	these studies. Unlike previous representations, the model is three-dimensional,
	incorporating both the left and right atria and the major muscle
	bundles of the atria, including the crista terminalis, pectinate
	muscles, limbus of the fossa ovalis, and Bachmann's bundle. The bundles
	are represented as anisotropic structures with fiber directions aligned
	with the bundle axes. Conductivities are assigned to the model to
	give realistic local conduction velocities within the bundles and
	bulk tissue. Results from simulations demonstrate the role of the
	bundles in a normal sinus rhythm and also reveal the patterns of
	activation in the septum, where experimental mapping has been extremely
	challenging. To validate the model, the simulated normal activation
	sequence and conduction velocities at various locations are compared
	with experimental observations and data. The model is also used to
	investigate paced activation, and a mechanism of the relative lengthening
	of left versus right stimulation is presented. Owing to both the
	realistic geometry and the bundle structures, the model can be used
	for further analysis of the normal activation sequence and to examine
	abnormal conduction, including flutter. The full text of this article

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We undertook this study to determine whether human atrial
	fibrillation (AF) relates to steeply sloped action potential duration
	restitution (APDR) kinetics and whether the spatial nonuniformity
	of APDR promotes persistence of AF. BACKGROUND: A steeply sloped
	APDR curve is known to be an important determinant of the induction
	of more complex action potential duration (APD) dynamics and fibrillation.
	METHODS: Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) (n = 18),
	paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) (n = 14) and normal control
	subjects (n = 9) were studied. The monophasic action potential duration
	at 90% repolarization (APD90) and the effective refractory period
	(ERP) were measured at six sites in the right atrium. After AF was
	electrically converted, APDR was assessed by delivering a single
	extrastimulus after a train of stimuli at a cycle length of 600 ms
	(S1S2) at six different sites of the right atrium, as well as rapid
	pacing at cycle lengths that induced APD alternans. RESULTS: The
	APD90 and ERP in patients with CAF were shorter than those in patients
	with PAF and control subjects (p < 0.05); however, the dispersions
	of APD90 and ERP in each group were similar. The maximal slopes of
	APDR by S1S2 and rapid pacing in patients with CAF (1.2 {+/-} 0.4
	and 1.7 {+/-} 0.2) and PAF (1.1 {+/-} 0.4 and 1.3 {+/-} 0.4) were
	higher than those in control subjects (0.5 {+/-} 0.3 and 0.8 {+/-}
	0.2, respectively; p < 0.01). The maximal slope obtained by S1S2
	did not differ from that obtained by rapid pacing in any group. The
	inter-regional difference of the maximal slope in patients with CAF
	(1.6 {+/-} 0.4, p < 0.05) was greater than that in patients with
	PAF (1.2 {+/-} 0.3, p = NS vs. control) and control subjects (0.4
	{+/-} 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation was related to steeply
	sloped (>1) APDR kinetics. The spatial dispersion of APDR in patients
	with chronic AF was greater than that of patients with paroxysmal
	AF and control subjects, indicating that the heterogeneity of APDR
	of the atrium plays an important role in the persistence of AF. },

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of selected inhomogeneities
	and anisotropies on computed electric potential fields associated
	with the electrocardiographic forward problem. The model construction
	was based on the Utah Torso model and included geometry for major
	anatomical structures such as subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle,
	and lungs, as well as for epicardial fatpads, major arteries and
	veins, and the sternum, ribs, spine, and clavicles. Measured epicardial
	potentials served as the electrical source for solutions to the electrocardiographic
	forward problems computed using the finite element method (FEM).
	The geometry of the torso model for each simulation was constant,
	but different combinations of conductivities were assigned to individual
	organs or tissues. Comparisons of different conductivity combinations
	followed one of two basic schemes: 1) a homogeneous torso served
	as the reference against which we compared simulations with a single
	organ or tissue and assigned its nominal conductivity, or 2) a fully
	inhomogeneous torso served as the reference and we removed the effect
	of individual organs or tissues by assigning it the homogeneous conductivity
	value. When single inhomogeneities were added to an otherwise homogeneous
	isotropic model, anisotropic skeletal muscle (at a 15:1 anisotropy
	ratio) and the right and left lung had larger average effects (12.8,
	12.7, and 12.1\% relative error (RE), respectively) than the other
	inhomogeneities tested. Our results for removing single inhomogeneities
	show that the subcutaneous fat, the anisotropic skeletal muscle (with
	the degree of anisotropy equal to 7:1), and the lungs have larger
	average impacts on the body surface potential distributions than
	other elements of the model (with values of 14.9, 12.6, and 11.7\%
	RE, respectively). The results also show that the size of the effect
	depended strongly on the distribution of epicardial potentials. The
	results of this study suggest that accurate representation of tissue
	inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the accuracy of the forward
	solution, with regions near the torso surface playing a larger role,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is thought to be due
	to multiple, simultaneously circulating wavelets. In the canine sterile
	pericarditis model, the mechanisms of maintenance of AF are not yet
	understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: During six induced AF episodes in
	six dogs with sterile pericarditis, 372 unipolar electrograms were
	recorded simultaneously from an electrode array placed around both
	atrial free walls, along with 10 to 24 electrodes from the atrial
	septum, by use of a multiplexing system. Activation maps during 12
	consecutive 100-ms windows were analyzed from an episode of sustained
	AF in each dog (mean duration, 32 +/- 24 minutes). In two dogs, two
	such activation maps during the same episode of AF were analyzed.
	During AF, multiple unstable reentrant circuits (mean number, 1.4
	+/- 0.1 per 100-ms analysis window) with very short cycle lengths
	(mean, 111 +/- 8 ms) present primarily in the atrial septum and right
	atrium were responsible for maintenance of AF. The unstable reentrant
	circuits frequently disappeared and re-formed. Wave fronts traveling
	from one atrium to the other and/or from the atrial septum play an
	important role in re-formation of unstable reentrant wave fronts.
	CONCLUSIONS: In this model of paroxysmal AF, unstable reentrant circuits
	of very short cycle length principally involving the atrial septum
	appear to be critical for maintenance of AF. Some reentrant circuits
	disappear as others re-form, so that at least one reentrant circuit
	is always present. Because the atria cannot follow their very short
	cycle lengths in a 1:1 manner, AF is maintained.},

	of Courtemanche et al. The simulated transmembrane potentials following
	a normal sinus beat, as well as those during atrial fibrillation,
	were projected on the 1297 nodes of the surface encapsulating all
	atrial myocytes (endocardium and epicardium). The transmembrane potentials
	at these nodes formed the source strengths of the elements of the
	equivalent generator, which were used to compute body surface potentials.
	RESULTS: After invoking slight adaptations of the timing of depolarization
	of the transmembrane potentials, the simulated signals during the
	P wave closely corresponded to recorded ones. The correspondence
	during the entire PR interval improved markedly after the inclusion
	of early repolarization effects in the interval between the end of
	the P wave and onset of QRS. This demanded a shortening of the mean
	action potential duration generated by the Courtemanche model. The
	simulated ECGs related to atrial fibrillation demonstrated the characteristic
	features of those clinically observed. CONCLUSIONS: The equivalent
	double layer is a useful source model for the genesis of atrial signals
	observed on the thorax. The interval from the end of the P wave to
	onset of QRS is not iso-electric. The Courtemanche model of the ion-kinetics
	of atrial cells needs to be adapted when applied to represent the
	activity of healthy, common' atrial myocytes.},

	Twenty one patients with lone PAF and 20 healthy volunteers (control
	group) were enrolled in the study. An orthogonal lead surface ECG
	was high-pass filtered at 0.8 Hz, averaged with template matching,
	and combined into a spatial magnitude ('unfiltered' technique). Results
	were compared with conventionally filtered (40-300 Hz) PSAECG. The
	filtered technique revealed no differences in P-wave duration between
	the two groups (121 +/- 12 vs 128 +/- 15 ms, control and PAF groups
	respectively, ns). Double-peaked P-wave spatial magnitudes (interpeak
	distance >30 ms) were revealed in 11 of 21 PAF patients but only
	in two of 18 controls (P<0.01). The nadir in the spatial magnitude
	was located significantly later in the PAF group (114 +/- 13 vs 103
	+/- 9 ms, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: 'Unfiltered' PSAECG revealed significant
	differences in orthogonal P-wave morphology in patients with lone
	PAF, indicating the possibility of an inter-atrial conduction delay,

	(ie, to predict body surface potential fields from pathways of depolarization).
	A perfused heart was suspended in a cylinder and surrounded with
	fluid of the conductivity of the lung. Computation of potential fields
	included conductivity and boundary effects and assumed a uniform
	double-layer source. Three instants (early, late, and mid QRS) during
	normal depolarization and one instant during a stimulated beat were
	studied. There was good qualitative agreement between recorded and
	predicted fields early and late in the QRS and during the stimulated
	beat, but there were quantitative differences. The cardiac generator
	was far stronger late in the QRS. In mid QRS, the agreement between
	recorded and predicted fields was very poor. To resolve questions
	raised in this study, potentials around a small volume of stimulated
	tissue were recorded and predicted. Recorded potentials were compared
	with potentials calculated (1) on the assumption that the cardiac
	generator is a uniform double layer and (2) on the assumption that
	all current flows along the long axes of the cardiac fibers. The
	recorded potentials compared most favorably with the second of these.
	These studies led to the opinion that the uniform double-layer assumption
	is inadequate for prediction of body surface potential fields from
	depolarization pathways. Other studies of the forward and inverse
	problem that assume a uniform double-layer source are considered
	to be successful and therefore disagree with this study's conclusion.
	It appears that the question needs further experimental study.},

	geometry was extracted from the visible female dataset. The sinoatrial
	node (SAN) and atrium, including crista terminalis (CT), pectinate
	muscles (PM), appendages (APG) and Bachmann's bundle (BB) were segmented
	in this work. Fibre orientation in CT, PM and BB was set to local

	atrial cell. Maximum conductances of Ito, IKr and ICa,L were modified
	for PM, CT, APG and atrioventricular ring to reproduce measured action
	potentials (AP). Pacemaker activity in the human SAN was reproduced
	by removing IK1, but including If, ICa,T, and gradients of channel
	conductances as described in previous studies for heterogeneous rabbit
	SAN.Anisotropic conduction was computed with a monodomain model using
	the finite element method. The transversal to longitudinal ratio
	of conductivity for PM, CT and BB was 1:9. Atrial working myocardium
	(AWM) was set to be isotropic.Simulation of atrial electrophysiology
	showed initiation of APs in the SAN centre. The excitation spread
	afterwards to the periphery near to the region of the CT and preferentially
	towards the atrioventricular region. The excitation extends over
	the right atrium along PM. Both CT and PM activated the right AWM.
	Earliest activation of the left atrium was through BB and excitation
	spread over to the APG. The conduction velocities were 0.6ms-1 for
	AWM, 1.2ms-1 for CT, 1.6ms-1 for PM and 1.1ms-1 for BB at a rate
	of 63bpm.The simulations revealed that bundles form dominant pathways
	for atrial conduction. The preferential conduction towards CT and
	along PM is comparable with clinical mapping. Repolarization is more
	homogeneous than excitation due to the heterogeneous distribution
	of electrophysiological properties and hence the action potential
	duration.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.
	In ablation procedures, identification of the reentrant pathways
	is vital. This has proven difficult because of the complex morphology
	of the atria. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the role
	of specific anatomic structures on reentry induction and maintenance.
	METHOD AND RESULTS: A computationally efficient, morphologically
	realistic, computer model of the atria was developed that incorporates
	its major structural features, including discrete electrical connections
	between the right and left atria, physiologic fiber orientation in
	three dimensions, muscle structures representing the crista terminalis
	(CT) and pectinate muscles, and openings for the veins and AV valves.
	Reentries were induced near the venous openings in the left and right
	atria, the mouth of the coronary sinus, and the free wall of the
	right atrium. The roles of certain muscular structures were ascertained
	by selectively removing the structures and observing how the propagation
	of activity was affected. CONCLUSION: (1) The muscular sheath of
	the coronary sinus acts as a pathway for a reentrant circuit and
	stabilizes any circuits that utilize the isthmus near the inferior
	vena cava. (2) Poor trans-CT coupling serves to stabilize flutter
	circuits. (3) Wall thickness is an important factor in the propagation
	of electrical activity, especially in the left atrium. (4) The openings
	of the inferior and superior venae cavae form natural anatomic anchors
	that make reentry easier to initiate by allowing for smaller ectopic
	beats to induce reentry.},

	Epicardial potentials, which are important for clinical application

	simulating epicardial potentials using a microcomputer-based heart-torso

	in a cubic close-packed structure. An action potential waveform with

	with the epicardial surface model constructed recently, are mounted
	in an inhomogeneous human torso model. Electric dipoles, which are
	proportional to the spatial gradient of the action potential, are
	generated in all the cell units. These dipoles give rise to a potential
	distribution on the epicardial surface, which is calculated by means
	of the boundary element method. The simulated epicardial potential

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional
	electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation
	(AF), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.
	METHODS: The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record
	action potentials, the effective refractory period (ERP) and ion
	currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically
	isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6 months) AF and
	39 patients in sinus rhythm. RESULTS: Stimulation at high rates (up
	to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the
	ERP in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum
	diastolic potential (MDP). Chronic AF was associated with a reduction
	in the ERP at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, P<0.05),
	and marked attenuation in rate effects on the ERP and repolarisation.
	The abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced
	depolarisation of the MDP in cells from patients with AF. The density
	of L-type Ca(2+) (I(CaL)) and transient outward K(+) (I(TO)) currents
	was significantly reduced in cells from patients with AF (by 60-65\%),
	whilst the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was increased, and
	the sustained outward current (I(KSUS)) was unaltered. Superfusion
	of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l)
	moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the ERP
	(228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-Aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged
	repolarisation and the ERP (by 35\%, P<0.05). However, the combination
	of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.
	CONCLUSION: Chronic AF in humans is associated with attenuation in
	adaptation of the atrial single cell ERP and MDP to fast rates, which
	may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in I(CaL) and
	I(TO).},

  abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that restitution of
	the cardiac action potential (AP) duration (APD) plays a major role
	in predisposing ventricular tachycardia to degenerate to ventricular
	fibrillation, whereas its role in atrial fibrillation is unclear.
	We used the Courtemanche human atrial cell model and the Luo-Rudy
	guinea pig ventricular model to compare the roles of electrical restitution
	in destabilizing spiral wave reentry in simulated two-dimensional
	homogeneous atrial and ventricular tissue. Because atrial AP morphology
	is complex, we also validated the usefulness of effective refractory
	period (ERP) restitution. ERP restitution correlated best with APD
	restitution at transmembrane potentials greater than or equal to
	-62 mV, and its steepness was a reliable predictor of spiral wave
	phenotype (stable, meandering, hypermeandering, and breakup) in both
	atrial and ventricular tissue. Spiral breakup or single hypermeandering
	spirals occurred when the slope of ERP restitution exceeded 1 at
	short diastolic intervals. Thus ERP restitution, which is easier
	to measure clinically than APD restitution, is a reliable determinant
	of spiral wave stability in simulated atrial and ventricular tissue.},

  abstract = {The rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Kr), plays a key role
	in repolarisation of cardiac ventricular action potentials (APs).
	In recent years, a novel clinical condition denoted the short QT
	syndrome (SQTS) has been identified and, very recently, gain in function
	mutations in the gene encoding the pore-forming sub-unit of the I(Kr)
	channel have been proposed to underlie SQTS in some patients. Here,
	computer simulations were used to investigate the effects of the
	selective loss of voltage-dependent inactivation of I(Kr) upon ventricular
	APs and on the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. I(Kr) and inactivation-deficient
	I(Kr) were incorporated into Luo-Rudy ventricular AP models. Inactivation-deficient
	I(Kr) produced AP shortening that was heterogeneous between endocardial,
	mid-myocardial, and epicardial ventricular cell models, irrespective
	of whether heterogeneity between these sub-regions was incorporated
	of slow delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) alone, or of I(Ks)
	together with that of transient outward K(+) current. The selective
	loss of rectification of I(Kr) did not augment transmural dispersion
	of AP repolarisation, as AP shortening was greater in mid-myocardial
	than in endo- or epicardial cell models. Simulated conduction through
	a 1 D transmural ventricular strand was altered by incorporation
	of inactivation-deficient I(Kr) and the reconstructed QT interval
	was shortened. Collectively, these results substantiate the notion
	that selective loss of I(Kr) inactivation produces a gain in I(Kr)
	function that causes QT interval shortening.},
