\chapter{Physiological and Mathematical Background}

The heart is one of the most important organs in the human body.
It is responsible for pumping blood around the arteries and veins of the human
body to all of the organs within.
The blood carries all of the oxygen, energy and other substances needed for the
body to continue to live to all parts of the body.
It also bears away all of the carbon dioxide and other waste products so that
they can be removed.

The heart does this via rhythmic and synchronised contractions.
The contractions are, in the healthy heart, initiated from one place and
synchronised via electrical signals conducted through the heart.
This conduction is aided by a number of specialised cell types.
