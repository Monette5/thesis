\chapter{Introduction}

Cardiac disease is one of the biggest causes of death in the UK, causing over
one third of all deaths.
In addition to the deaths, many more people suffer the after effects of a heart
attack or live with the difficulties caused by heart failure~\cite{bhf2008}.
These figures are duplicated across much of the developed world.

Mathematical modelling of the heart offers a way of gaining insight into the
cardiac processes and the mechanisms of cardiac disease.
It is a well established field of research with numerous international journals
and conferences discussing the findings.
Mathematical models allow physiological effects to be dissected and quantified
in ways that can be difficult for in vivo and in vitro experiments.
This can be used to inform both further experiments and clinical diagnosis and
treatment.

Mathematical models exist for many different types of cardiac cells and
cardiac tissue.
Many studies of cardiac tissue focus on the ventricles, with atrial studies less
common.
This is in part because failure of the ventricles can have a much more serious
impact, but in spite of this, the atria represent an interesting target to
study.
They have a complex electrophysiology and topology.

This study therefore aims to construct a series of models and tools for studying
the atriums of the heart.
This involves modelling the atria and their processes on a wide variety of scales,
from the single cell to the whole atrium.
To enhance the clinical relevance of the study, a model of the atrium sitting
within the human torso will also be constructed.
This will allow the P-wave ECG to be calculated, the first view many cardiac
physicians will have of a failing atrium.
The tools will then be used to study a variety of factors which influence atrial
behaviour.
