\section{Cardiac Simulation Toolkit}

To extract useful results from cardiac modelling two principle components are
needed, as has been previously mentioned: the mathematical models used for
cardiac activity and a computational representation of the experimental
protocols followed to produce results.  A cardiac simulation toolkit provides
one or both of these components to an investigator, removing the need for the
investigator to implement those components themselves.

The
advantages to the investigator vary from toolkit to toolkit, but the
major one is

Cardiac simulation toolkits have existed in one form or another for some
time and include both commercial and open source 
Several cardiac simulation systems have previously been released, one of
the first of which is the OXSOFT HEART~\cite{Noble-1999}.
