\section{The Electrocardiograph}

The electrocardiograph, or ECG, was developed by Einthoven and colleagues at the
turn of the 20th century.
The Einthoven ECG used the string galvanometer, developed by Einthoven, to
record the potential differences between three sets of electrodes, or leads.
These electrodes were placed on each arm and on the left leg.
These three electrodes form the bases of many ECGs recorded to this day.
The string galvanometer was highly sensitive electrical recording device for its
time, and was developed by Einthoven.
For the development of the ECG and the string galvanometer, Einthoven was awarded
the nobel prize in 1924~\cite{Kligfield2002,TEXTBOOKS}.

Since Einthoven's day, the ECG has been continually refined.
This refinement has included both improvements in the way that individual leads
are measured, and new leads that are recorded.
In addition, there have been a number of specialised lead sets developed for
particular purposes, such as exercise recording and 24 hour measurement.
Research into new lead sets, to better understand the functioning of the heart,
continues to this day~\cite{PAPERS}.

\subsection{Lead Theory}

In Einthoven's original conception of the heart and the electrical field it
produced, he developed the ``Einthoven Triangle''.
The Einthoven triangle is an equilateral triangle.
At its corners sit the three electrodes and the sides of the triangles are the
leads themselves.
At the centroid of the triangle sits the heart, which is represented by a
single, stationary, time varying dipole.
The potentials measured at the three electrodes are the potentials assuming the
system is two dimensional, homogeneous and infinite in extent.
This was not entirely incorrect.

Modern lead theory was developed in the 1950's.
In a series of three papers McFee and
Johnston~\cite{McFee1953,McFee1954a,McFee1954b}\ set out their concept of the
``lead field'' which is still considered applicable today.
This theory, which was a further generalisation of work by Burger and van
Milaan, allowed for a heart which consisted of distributed dipole sources
sitting in a three dimensional, finite and inhomogeneous medium.
